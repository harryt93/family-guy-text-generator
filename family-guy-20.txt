LOIS: Smoking. How does a boy like that go so wrong?
PETER: They live in a crummy neighborhood.
BRIAN: The Bradys?
PETER: Yeah. They got robbers, thugs, drug dealers. You name it.
GUY: You folks want some pancakes? 
PETER: No, thanks. See, that's the worst we got is Jemima's Witnesses.

MEG: Mom, my lips are too thin. Can I please get collagen injections? 
LOIS: Meg, you don't need to change the way you look. You know, most of the world's problems stem from poor self-image.

STEWIE: Excellent! The mind-control device is nearing completion!
LOIS: Stewie, I said no toys at the table.
STEWIE: Damn you, vile woman! You've impeded my work since the day I escaped from your wretched womb.
LOIS: Don't pout, honey. When you were born the doctor said you were the happiest looking baby he'd ever seen.
STEWIE: But, of course. That was my victory day. The fruition of my deeply-laid plans to escape from that cursed ovarian bastille! Return the device, woman!
LOIS: No toys, Stewie.
STEWIE: Very well, then. Mark my words, when you least expect it, your uppance will come! 

MEG: Mom, can I turn the heat up?
LOIS: Don't touch the thermostat, Meg. Your father gets upset.
MEG: Come on. This thing goes up to 90.
PETER: Who touched the thermostat?
MEG: God, how does he always know?
PETER: Brain implant, Meg. Every father's got one. Tells you when the kids mess with the dial.
GUY: My thing went off! Your thermostat okay?
PETER: Yeah, it's all right.
GUY: Is my kid over here? Forget it! False alarm!

BRIAN: Ass ahoy. Peter, it's 7:00 and you've still got your pants on. What's the occasion?
LOIS: He's going to a stag party.
PETER: Lois, I work hard all week to provide for this family. I am the man of the house. As the man, I order you to give me permission to go to this party.
LOIS: Look, at least promise me you won't drink. Alcohol always leads to trouble.
PETER: Come on. You're worrying about nothing.
LOIS: Remember when you got drunk off the Communion wine at church? And then there was that time at the ice cream store. Promise me, Peter.
PETER: Lois, honey, I promise. Not a drop of alcohol is gonna touch these lips tonight.

PETER: Who wants to play Drink The Beer?
QUAGMIRE: Right here.
PETER: You win.
QUAGMIRE: All right. What do I win?
PETER: Another beer! 

PETER: I feel kind of bad, guys.I promised my wife I wouldn't drink.
QUAGMIRE: Don't feel bad, Peter.
PETER: Gee. I never thought of it like that.

GUY: Did you bring the porno?
PETER: Did I bring the porno? You're gonna love it. It's a classic.

GUY: What is this? Man.
PETER: My kid must've taped over this for history class.
GUY: The Statue of Liberty? What are we gonna do?
PETER: Boys, we're gonna drink till she's hot.
QUAGMIRE: That's just crazy enough to work.

LOIS: Meg, finish your pancakes. Chris, elbows off your father.
PETER: Thanks, son.
LOIS: A great example for the kids, Peter.
CHRIS: Yeah. A new family record. Way to raise the bar, Dad.
LOIS: Chris, you're 13. Don't talk like that.
PETER: Kids, Daddy only drank so the Statue of Liberty would take her clothes off.
LOIS: What did you promise me last night?
PETER: I wouldn't drink at the stag party.
LOIS: And what did you do?
PETER: Drank at the stag I almost walked right into that one. God! Feels like accountants are cranking adding machines in my head.
LOIS: You see? A hangover is nature's way of telling you I was right. I mean 
MEG: Mom, are you all right? 
LOIS: My goodness. This chair leg was loose. Isn't that silly? I could've broken my neck.
STEWIE: Damn!
PETER: Honey. I took a cab home, I slept on the table so I wouldn't wake you up. Nothing bad happened.
LOIS: I guess you're right.
PETER: Apology accepted. All right, I'm going to work. Somebody's gotta put food on this table.

WEED: How are you coming, Johnson? 
PETER: Mr.Weed, I've been working on the new G.I.Jew line. And as you can see, they look great. 
GUY: You call these bagels? 
PETER: I'm glad he's on our side!
WEED: Peter! 
PETER: What?
WEED: Are you sleeping on the job?
PETER: No. There's a bug in my eye and I'm trying to suffocate him.
WEED: Peter, I like you. But I need you to be more than just eye candy around here. It's your job to watch for toys that could be hazardous to kids. Now, look sharp!
PETER: Yes, sir! 

DIANE: Quite a situation we've got here, Tom.
TOM: Quite a situation we've got here, Tom, indeed, Diane. The Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Company of Quahog, Rhode Island has released highly unsafe products into the retail market. 

WEED: Peter, I'm appalled. Your negligence has damaged this company's reputation. You're fired!
PETER: Jeez. For how long?

BRIAN: My God! You got fired?
CHRIS: Way to go, Dad! Fight the machine!
STEWIE: How do you know about the machine?
PETER: Don't worry. I'll still put food on this table. Just not as much. So it might get a little competitive.
MEG: Who cares about food? Now we'll never be able to afford my lip injections!
BRIAN: Can we put her out in the yard for a while?
LOIS: Okay, who's hungry?

PETER: Jeez. How the hell am I gonna break this to Lois? If she finds out I got fired for drinking, she's gonna blame me!
DEVIL: Lie to her. It's okay to lie to women. They're not people like us.
PETER: I don't know.
PETER: Hey, where's the other guy? 

PETER: Look, I don't want your mom to worry, all right? When she worries, she says, I told you so and Stop doing that. I'm asleep. So I'm just gonna tell a little lie, okay? Not a word to your mom about me getting canned.
LOIS: What's that, Peter? 
PETER: Nothing. The lost-my-job smells great.
LOIS: What?
PETER: Meg, honey, can you pass the fired-my-ass-for-negligence?
LOIS: Peter, are you feeling okay?
PETER: I feel great! I haven't got a job in the world.
LOIS: All right, then let's eat. I know you all hate eggplant, but What on earth was that?
STEWIE: What the deuce are you staring at? It's tuna fish and nothing else.

BRIAN: How's your job search going?
PETER: It sucks, Brian. I've already been through two jobs this week. I got fired off of that commercial. Then I had that job as the sneeze guard for that restaurant's salad bar. I thought I could win money in that talent show.
BRIAN: Peter, I know it's a dangerous precedent but you might want to tell Lois the truth.
PETER: What? That I can't provide for my family? That she's always right? That I didn't stand up to a tank in Tiananmen Square?
BRIAN: You can't keep lying to her about losing your job. Eventually, she'll find out where you're going every day.
PETER: Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Okay, I'll tell her tonight.

LOIS: I'll need the checkbook in the morning. I'm going to Stop 'N Shop for some sweet corn.
PETER: You're spending money on food again? Lois, we just had dinner.
LOIS: I enjoyed it so much, I thought we'd eat again tomorrow. Since when are you so concerned about our food budget?
PETER: I just Lois, this is really hard for me to say, but 
LOIS: What is it, Peter?
PETER: You're getting kind of fat.
LOIS: What?
PETER: It's just It's not healthy.
LOIS: Peter, I do my Jane Fonda workout tape three times a week. When was the last time you saw your toes?
PETER: I thought you people were supposed to be jolly.
LOIS: Peter, what the hell is the matter with you? Honey, if there's something wrong, you can tell me.
PETER: I promise you, everything's fine. You got nothing to worry about.
STEWIE: Well, well, Mother! We meet again! Stewie, I thought I tucked you in an hour ago. Not tightly enough it would seem. And now you contemptible harpy I shall end your reign of matriarchal tyranny.
LOIS: You can play tomorrow, honey. Right now it's bedtime. Blast you and your estrogenical treachery! 
PETER: Sweet dreams, kiddo. You have the power to end this!

BRIAN: How'd she take it?
PETER: I told her she was fat.
BRIAN: No.
PETER: I hate lying to Lois. It's just It's the best way to keep her from the truth.
BRIAN: You have no choice. Your unemployment will dry up soon. She'll probably sense something's amiss when they repossess your house. You really oughta think of your family's welfare.
PETER: Jeez, Brian! That's a great idea!

GUY: Okay, do you have any disabilities, past injuries, physical anomalies?
PETER: I didn't have gas for the first time until I was 30.

PETER: Guys, our money problems are over! We're officially on welfare. Come on, help me scatter car parts on the front lawn.
MEG: How much are we getting?
PETER: Let's see. $150 a week.
MEG: Wait. That's a comma, not a decimal.
PETER: Whoops.

LOIS: No, I haven't seen Peter all afternoon. I was giving a piano lesson. Stewie, why don't you play in the other room?
STEWIE: Why don't you burn in hell?
LOIS: No dessert for you, young man.

PETER: Who would've thought getting drunk would get me $150,000 a week from the government? This is why I don't vote.
CHRIS: Maybe somebody down there was drinking, too.
BRIAN: Peter, you might want to call the Welfare Commission. That check is obviously an oversight.
PETER: Not necessarily. Maybe I'm like their one millionth customer.
BRIAN: What? You're gonna spend $150,000 a week?
PETER: Yeah.
BRIAN: On what?

LOIS: Oh, my God! Peter, you bought the statue of David?
PETER: No. I just rented it. But they're gonna be ticked. The penis broke off while I was loading it into the car.

WEED: I shall call you "Eduardo.

LOIS: Peter, how can we afford this?
CHRIS: You won't believe it, Mom! Dad's getting 
PETER: A big raise! 
LOIS: Peter, that's wonderful! 
CHRIS: But, Dad, I thought 
PETER: The kind of raise that'll allow me to give my kids a big allowance just for keeping their big mouths shut. Come on, guys. I'll buy us the most expensive meal we've ever had.

PETER: Yeah. I'd like 6,000 chicken fa-ji-tas, please.
CLERK: I beg your pardon? And a "So-sage" McBiscuit, please.

LOIS: Peter, what's the big surprise?
PETER: You know how I always said you should be treated like a queen? I got you your own jester.
JESTER: Good to be here in New England. And what's the deal with "New" England anyway? It's over 200 years old! Last time I checked, that's not that new.

PETER: This is great. I can finally afford to give my little girl the lips she's always dreamed of.
MEG: Thank you, Daddy! 
LOIS: I don't know, Peter. Lips are one thing. But did you have to buy breast implants for Chris?
PETER: It makes him happy.
CHRIS: These are cool.

GUY: When did you get a pool?
LOIS: It's a moat. I know it's silly but my husband thinks our family needs extra protection now that we're rich.
GUY: Does it work?
LOIS: It does keep the Black Knight at bay.
GUY: Congratulations in all your success. Here's your welfare check.
LOIS: What the

PETER: Hi, honey. What?
PETER: I know what I did was wrong. But I only did it for you and the kids. Except for the jukebox in the bathroom. That was for Peter.
LOIS: Yeah, from the American taxpayers. I am so mad I can't see straight.
PETER: No problem. We got money to get that fixed with enough left for us to buy our way out of any trouble our kids might get into. Just like the Kennedys.
LOIS: I feel like I don't even know you anymore, Peter. The man I married would never think he could fix a problem just by spending money!

PETER: Boy, she's pretty pissed.
BRIAN: Who thought fraud would be one of her buttons?
PETER: Why have a jukebox in the john if your wife's mad at you?
BRIAN: Peter, you may have to return that money to the taxpayers.
PETER: But I gotta make sure Lois knows I'm doing it. I need an event with thousands of people. Something that everybody cares about. We might have to leave Rhode Island for this.

GUY: The air is electric here at Super Bowl XXXIII tonight! Pat, it's safe to say that all these fans came out here to watch a game of football!
GUY: John, we're in commercial. Yeah, I know. I'm just making conversation. Come on. Football!

BRIAN: Amazing. You can barely drive a car. Yet you were allowed to fly a blimp? 
PETER: Yeah, America's great, isn't it? Except for the South. Boy, I hope Lois is watching. 
PETER: Okay, taxpayers, here you go! 

GUY: Looks like we're getting some rain here tonight, John.
GUY: Yeah. Hey, wait a second! This is no ordinary rain! It's some kind of crazy money rain! I'm being told it's a man and his dog throwing cash out of a blimp.

PETER: Man. I hope this works. Otherwise, I'm gonna have to start dropping these.

BRIAN: How was your shower?
PETER: I tell you, all of the rumors about dropping the soap are true.
BRIAN: Really?
PETER: You can't hold onto that thing to save your life. It was slipping everywhere. Guys were laughing.
GUY: There's the guy that couldn't hold the soap.
GUY: That was classic.

PETER: Boy. I really let Lois down this time. Do you think she'll wait for me?
BRIAN: If every woman dumped her husband for crashing a blimp, no one would be married.
PETER: Yeah, you're right. Okay, I got the top bunk.

MEG: My collagen is wearing off.
LOIS: Honey, sagging lips are just nature's way of telling you you shouldn't cover for your father's lie.
CHRIS: What does it mean when your armpits cry stinky tears?
LOIS: It means you're becoming a man. But hopefully not the kind who stays out all day and doesn't call like your father who shall remain nameless.
STEWIE: Hello, Mother.
LOIS: Hi there, sweetie.
STEWIE: You know, Mother, life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get. Your life, however, is more like a box of active grenades! Now, I offer one last chance for deliverance. Return my mind-control device or be destroyed.
LOIS: You just want your toy back. Okay, here you go, honey.
STEWIE: Yes Well, victory is mine! 
STEWIE: Damn you all! 

LOIS: Hello? Oh, my God!

PETER: Lois, am I glad to see you.
LOIS: I have nothing to say to you, Peter.
PETER: I gave the money back. Why are you still steamed?
LOIS: Peter, you lied to me, you betrayed my trust. Compared to that, welfare fraud doesn't even matter. Really? Let's hope the judge feels that way.


GUY: This court will come to order.
PETER: I figured the sooner I cashed the check the sooner they'd catch their mistake. Why are we making a federal case out of this?
GUY: Don't you think you should have alerted the government of such a gross overpayment?
PETER: I was gonna call them. But my favorite episode of Different Strokes was on. The one where Arnold and Dudley get sexually molested by the bike shop owner? And everybody learns a valuable lesson.
GUY: Griffin, have you learned a lesson?
PETER: Yes. Stay the hell away from that bike shop.
PETER: Okay, everybody, I feel really bad about what I did. I just I don't know. I saw the one chance l'd ever have to give my family the things they deserve. I guess I screwed it up. I cheated the government. And worst of all, I lied to my wife. And she deserves better. I'm sorry, honey.
GUY: Griffin, I think your words have touched us all. I'm sentencing you to 24 months in prison.
LOIS: Excuse me, Your Honor? 
GUY: Yes?
LOIS: Look, my husband may be a bit thoughtless at times. He may even be downright stupid. But I know he only accepted that money because he wanted to be a good husband and father. But what he needs to remember is that we love him. And no matter what, I'll always stand by him.
PETER: I love you too, honey.
GUY: That was very moving, Lois. Okay, you can go to jail with him!
STEWIE: What? Intolerable as it may be I'm completely dependent upon those wretched drones for sustenance. Let us see how the constitution of American justice fares against the device!
GUY: Is that your boy?
PETER: What? Yeah. That's Stewie.
GUY: Gosh. I can't separate a kid that young from his father. It's unjudgmenly. Hell, you've learned your lesson, right?
PETER: Yeah.
GUY: All right. You're free.
PETER: Wow! Can you give me my job back?
GUY: No.
GUY: Yes.
PETER: All right! 

LOIS: It's good to have you home, Peter.
PETER: Honey, I knew everything would turn out okay. 
MEG: I sure am gonna miss being rich.
PETER: Don't worry. I got a way to get money.
LOIS: Not another welfare scam?
PETER: No. Minority scholarship.
LOIS AND BRIAN: No.
STEWIE: Are you insane?
PETER: Okay, I mean sexual harassment suit.
BRIAN: No.
LOIS: Don't think so.
STEWIE: Absolutely outrageous.
PETER: Okay, disability claim.

LOIS: Look at Stewie. Isn't he adorable playing with his Sesame Street phone?

STEWIE: Put me through to the Pentagon.
GUY: What sound does a cow make?
STEWIE: Don't toy with me! I've already dispatched with Mr. Hooper. I've six armed men outside Big Bird's nest. And as for Linda? It's difficult for a deaf woman to hear an assassin approach, isn't it? GUY: Can you count to three?
STEWIE: Indeed I can. One! Two! Three! Can I count to three? For God's sake, I'm already shooting at a fifth-grade level.

LOIS: Come on, Stewie. You can't leave the table until you finish your vegetables.
STEWIE: Then I shall sit here until one of us expires. You've got a good 40 years on me, woman!
LOIS: Sweetie, it's broccoli. It's good for you. Now open up for the airplane.
STEWIE: Never! Damn the broccoli! Damn you! And damn the Wright Brothers!
LOIS: My, aren't we fussy tonight. Okay. No broccoli. 
STEWIE: Very well then. Who the hell do you think you are?
LOIS: Honey, it's not gonna go away just because you don't like it.
STEWIE: Well, then. My goal becomes clear. The broccoli must die.

MEG: Mom, will you take me out to practice driving?
LOIS: I'm teaching a piano lesson in half an hour. Maybe your father can take you.
PETER: Sorry, Meg. Daddy loves you. But Daddy also loves Star Trek. And, in all fairness, Star Trek was here first.
LOIS: For God's sake, Peter. You've been in front of the TV since you got home from work. Why don't you spend some time with your family? I will, during the commercials. And if that's wrong, maybe I'm missing the point of having commercials.
MEG: Please. My road test is tomorrow and you haven't taught me anything.
BRIAN: You may want to find a better teacher than Peter.
PETER: What are you talking about? I'm a great driver.
PETER: I don't miss a thing.

PETER: All right, Meg. Now here's your first lesson. You always want to be aware of other cars on the road. If you catch eyes with the guy next to you at a red light, you gotta race him. This guy's asking for it.
MEG: But Dad
PETER: I don't make the rules, honey. Now rev your engine twice.
MEG: Okay.
PETER: Go! 
PETER: You forgot to flip him off. But other than that, nice job.

LOIS: You're back already? That wasn't much of a lesson.
PETER: I didn't want to overload her on her first time out. Besides Chips is about to start. So let's sit back and get lost in a world of California Highway Patrol fantasy! 

STEWIE: So, broccoli, Mother says you're very good for me. I'm afraid I'm no good for you! The first rule of war is know thine enemy. And I know this! Cold kills broccoli! It's so simple. All I need to do is build a machine to control the global environment. Forecast for tomorrow, a few sprinkles of genius with a chance of doom! 

PETER: This is taking forever! Come on. Let's go. Fox is running one of those new reality shows at 8:00. Fast Animals, Slow Children.
MEG: Dad, we can't leave now. My entire life depends on getting my license. If I can't drive, I'll never have a boyfriend, never get married and then I'll have to adopt a kid like Rosie O'Donnell.
PETER: Are you implying that Rosie O'Donnell can't drive?
MEG: I'm so nervous.
PETER: You're gonna do great. Remember everything I taught you.

GUY: Let's start by going down Main Street.
Meg: Okay.
GUY: What are you doing?
MEG: I'm driving.
MEG: Are you gonna mark me down for not flipping him off? 

MEG: God, my life is over. I am the biggest loser I know!
PETER:  I know how you feel, pumpkin. I've had my share of disappointments, too.

MEG: Dad, watch out! 
PETER: Meg, honey, are you okay?
MEG: Yeah, I think so.
PETER: The Quahog Cable Television Transmitter.
GUY: You just knocked out cable TV for the whole town!
PETER: Boy! Look. There's Bigfoot!
GUY: Whoa. This isn't about me. This is about you.
PETER: At least I bought us some time. She did it.
MEG: What? Dad, you were the one driving!
PETER: I was teaching her to drive and she lost control of the car. Come on, we all did stupid stuff when we were kids, right? I remember when I tried to sneak into an R-rated movie. Come on. Give the kid a break, huh?
GUY: Why should we?
PETER: She got her arm shot off in Vietnam.
GUY: Poor kid.
GUY: What a senseless war.

MEG: I can't believe you just sold out your own daughter.
PETER: I know what I did was wrong. And I know it's not the first time I've embarrassed you. I hate to see you so upset. I know. Let's play a little game called Taking the Fall for Daddy. If you win, I'll buy you a convertible when you get your license.
MEG: Really? Daddy! Now I love you again!
PETER: You're gonna make some Jewish guy a great wife.

GUY: Because of an accident at the Quahog Cable Company television transmission will be out for an undetermined amount of time. Of course, no one can see this news program so it doesn't really matter what we say. I'm the Lord Jesus Christ. Think I'll go get drunk and beat up midgets. How about you? Tom, I just plain don't like black people.
GUY: You guys, we're still on in Boston.

STEWIE: Excellent. The weather machine is nearly completed. What do you say to that, broccoli? Stop mocking me! What's this? It appears the witless provider has finally brought me something of value.
I can use that crude device to amplify my deadly signal. Victory shall yet be mine.

MEG: Guess what, Mom? Dad crashed the car into the city cable transmitter.
LOIS: What?
MEG: It's okay. If I take the blame, he'll buy me a convertible when I get my license.
PETER: Meg, it's not exactly taking the blame if you go around telling everyone. 
LOIS: Peter, you're bribing your daughter with a car?
PETER: Come on, Lois. Isn't "bribe" just another word for "love"? You wanted me and Meg to bond. That's what we're doing.
CHRIS: Dad, I was in a chat room on America Online and Doomie 22 told me some idiot knocked out the cable. We could be without TV for weeks!
PETER: Now, Chris, now let's not panic. We can manage just fine without TV.
BRIAN: Hah.
PETER: What's that supposed to mean?
BRIAN: Face it, you're addicted to television.
PETER: I'll be fine.
LOIS: Are you sure, honey?
PETER: For God's sake, you guys. You think I'm some simp who can't live without TV? Give me a break.

PETER: I don't know how much longer I can last. It's been a whole week since I seen a TV show. I wonder what Scooby and the gang are up to now.
BRIAN: You just need to find something to fill the void that's left in your life. Lois has knitting, Chris has video games, Meg's learning how to drive. And me, I like the sauce. Whose leg do you have to hump to get a dry martini around here? 
PETER: Can't live without TV. Must see TV.

LOIS: Stewie, I expect you to finish off your vegetables.
STEWIE: Rest assured, you relentless harridan, I expect I shall finish them all off! And you as well!
LOIS: Brian, I'm a little worried about Peter. Last night I woke up and he was channel surfing through static. I'm sure he'll find a way to cope.
PETER: Morning, Lois.
BRIAN: And you were worried.
LOIS: Peter, what the hell is that?
PETER: It's my favorite TV family, the Griffins.
LOIS: Peter, you're scaring me. I'm beginning to think you're losing your grip on reality.
PETER: Boring. I'll go see what else is on.
LOIS: Peter! Keep an eye on Stewie.

PETER: It's Glen Quagmire, the wacky next-door neighbor.
PETER: What's he up to this time?
QUAGMIRE: I'm going to work!
PETER: Him and his crazy get-rich-quick schemes.

LOIS: We have to find your father, Chris. He's not well.
CHRIS: I never knew anyone who went crazy before except my invisible friend Col.

PETER: Schwartz! I get all the channels on this thing. Lifetime. CBS. Hey, UPN. All right. 90210.

MEG: Dad?
PETER: Meg, what are you doing at West Beverly? They're really reaching for guest stars in the 10th season. 
MEG: Dad, what are you doing? Get out of here! I'm already a total outcast because of you!
PETER: You're just upset because you wrecked the cable transmitter.
MEG: I did not! Forget it. What good is a car if I have no friends? I didn't wreck TV! My dad did!
GUY: What?
GUY: What'd she say?
GUY: Peter Griffin ruined TV?
GUY: And blamed his daughter?
GUY: That's the lowest thing I've ever heard.
LOIS: Peter, take that thing off and come home.
PETER: Hey, Lois. You're just in time for the exciting conclusion. Looks like some boob's about to get lynched. Let's watch.
GUY: There they are.
GUY: That's the guy who ruined our cable.
GUY: Let's get him!
LOIS: Stop! What is wrong with you people? Okay, yes. My husband is responsible for knocking out TV. But we should be thanking him. He's broken television's hypnotic spell over us. Now we can see the world for what it is a beautiful place full of wonderful things just waiting to be experienced.
PETER: Another chick flick.
GUY: She's right. All the hours we've wasted on that damn idiot box.
GUY: I'm gonna paint my house!
GUY: I'll build a ship in a bottle.
GUY: I'm gonna push a hoop with a stick down a dirt road.
LOIS: I'll take you home, honey.

PETER: I can't believe I let Meg take the blame. You were right, Lois. TV is evil. I hear that Manson guy watches it in jail all day long.
LOIS: You just went a little overboard. You need a little balance in your life.nmThere are other things to appreciate besides television.
PETER: You mean like this lamp? 
LOIS: Yeah. Okay. The lamp gives us light.
PETER: I get it.
LOIS: And your family gives you love. You should spend some time with our kids, Peter. And with me.
PETER: What could me and you do together? 
PETER: Lois! You've got a sick mind!
LOIS: Peter, I'm talking about making love.
PETER: I thought you wanted us to murder the children and harvest their organs for beer money.

STEWIE: Excellent! Thus completes the penultimate adjustment to my weather control device! Victory is Release me at once!
PETER: Your mother was right. It'd be a crime to sit around and wait for the TV.
MEG: Great. You can teach me how to drive.
PETER: There'll be time to drive when you're dead. There's a world out there waiting for us to grab it by the short hairs!
STEWIE: Damn!
PETER: Let's go.

CHRIS: I'm so tired.
MEG: This morning's fly-fishing really wore me out.
LOIS: Now, kids, your father's just trying to spend time with his family. Or kill us. I'm not sure which.

STEWIE: Thank God! Their puerile minds are once again distracted by that flickering box. Time to be bad! 
PETER: Come on, everyone. We're late for the Bavarian Folk Festival. You know those Germans. You don't join their party, they come get you.
CHRIS: But Dad, the TV's back on.
PETER: What do you know? Okay, let's go.
LOIS: Peter, I'm thrilled that you want to spend so much time with the family. But we're exhausted. Maybe we could just sit and watch some TV together?
PETER: We're too busy living life to the fullest. Come on, let's go.
MEG: I'm sick of life.
CHRIS: Yeah.
BRIAN: My dogs are barking.
PETER: But I thought we were having fun.
MEG: We were. But now it might be nice to watch other people have fun or get killed. You know, whatever's on.
LOIS: Look, Peter. It's your favorite show.
PETER: Sorry, Lois. There's only one show I want to see. It's called Make Every Day Count, starring Peter Griffin as himself.
LOIS: Come on, Peter. Don't you miss TV just a little? The familiar stories, the broadly drawn characters, the convenient plot turns that bring a character around at exactly the right moment?

GUY: Hi. I'm William Shatner. My car broke down on my way to give a speech on how TV keeps families together. Would you like to hear it?
PETER: No, I don't want to miss the all-you-can-eat schnitzel bar.
GUY: Wait a minute! I love schnitzel! Come along.
PETER: I bet you could squeeze into Lois' lederhosen.
GUY: I'll change in the car.

MEG: If I had a nickel for every time one of my parents walked out instead of teaching me how to drive, I'd be one rich little
LOIS: Let's go, Meg.

STEWIE: Fare thee well, broccoli!

GUY: I don't know. I can't imagine choosing life over television.
PETER: I'm telling you, it's great, Bill. The only thing that would make this perfect day better is if my family was here.
GUY: My God! It was sunny a moment ago, but now it's pouring!
PETER: Let's take off our shoes and run home barefoot!
GUY: Griffin, you're a madman! Barefoot, you say?

LOIS: This is not safe. I'll teach you how to drive some other time. Pull over.
MEG: Mom, I can't even tell where "over" is.

GUY: You were right, Peter. I've never felt so alive.

STEWIE: Victory is mine! 
STEWIE: God damn it.

GUY: My God.
MEG: My God. I hit William Shatner.
GUY: Light growing dimmer. Can't breathe. Beam me up, God.

PETER: I did not see that coming.
MEG: Daddy, I'm sorry I ran you over and killed Mr. Shatner.
PETER: Don't worry. Once I'm of this body cast, I'll do enough living for me and Bill.
LOIS: Honey, can't we go back to the way things used to be? There's a big dent in that couch that nobody else can fill.
PETER: Haven't you guys learned anything? TV took over my life once. I'm never gonna let that happen again.
LOIS: My God. We've lost him.

PETER: Turn that TV off. Nurse? 

MEG: Daddy, now that I've finally passed my driver's test can I still get a convertible?
PETER: No. But I'm proud of you for getting your license, sweetheart.
LOIS: And I'm proud of you, Peter. You taught us all a valuable lesson.

LOIS: Everything's all set for Stewie's birthday party. I can't believe he's almost a year old.
PETER: Yeah. I'll never forget the day he was born.

GUY: One more push, Lois.
GUY: This is a miracle, Mr. Griffin. Would you like to see?
PETER: Yeah, I've never actually seen a baby being Oh, God!
GUY: Congratulations. It's a boy.
GUY: Wait a minute. I don't think we're through.
LOIS: Oh, my God! Is it twins?
DOCTOR: No. It's a map of Europe.

LOIS: I confirmed everything with the birthday party planner at Cheesie Charlie's.
PETER: Why Cheesie Charlie's?
CHRIS: It's cool, Dad. They have this game where you put in a dollar and you win four quarters! I win every time! I get to go, right?
PETER: Why can't we have the same kind of party we always do? 
LOIS: Peter, this could be our last first birthday ever. When Meg and Chris turned one, I had so much to do, I missed everything.

PETER: Lois, you won't believe this! Meg just said "Da-Da!"
LOIS: Her first words?
PETER: Then she stood up by herself and started walking!
LOIS: Her first steps?
PETER: Yeah. What the hell are you doing in here anyway?

LOIS: Thanks to Cheesie Charlie l'm not gonna miss a moment of Stewie's party.
STEWIE: I say, am I to spend the entire day wallowing around in my own feces? A little service here!
LOIS: Hey, Stinky. Have we got some big plans for you.
STEWIE: Plans? What the devil are you talking about?
CHRIS: It's your birthday, dude.
LOIS: Saturday's gonna be real special, honey. I've hired a professional to make sure everything goes just right.
STEWIE: A professional? There's treachery afoot! 

LOIS: Meg, you're home late.
MEG: I stayed after school to try out for cheerleading.
PETER: Don't keep me in suspense. How'd you do?
MEG: I'll give you a hint. I S-U-C-K-E-D! Sucked!
PETER: Yay! I mean, sorry, honey.
MEG: God, I hate high school. I don't fit in with anyone.
PETER: Boy. Do I know that feeling.
MEG: I don't get it. The more I try to make friends, the more people hate me.
PETER: Listen. You're a one-of-a-kind girl with a mind of her own. Now, see, that's what people hate.
MEG: Really?
PETER: I'm telling you, just be the girl you think everyone else wants you to be.
MEG: Wow, it's so obvious. Thanks, Daddy.
MEG: Hi, Mom. Bye, Mom.
LOIS: I haven't seen Meg this happy since that bus broke down in front of our house.
PETER: Meg and I had a little father-daughter talk.
LOIS: It seems to have worked.
PETER: I wasn't just blowing smoke when I bought this T-shirt.
LOIS: Well, you're the number-one husband, too.
PETER: I know. That's why I bought this T-shirt.

STEWIE: Dear Diary, It seems the domestic overseers are plotting against me. Their plans somehow relate to the anniversary of my escape from the womb. I'm still haunted by the memories of how I was incarcerated in that amniotic Attica. As I recall, it was every potential man for himself. I alone had reached the target objective, thanks to the intrepidity I developed at testicular boot camp. But it was a trap! I was imprisoned in that uterine gulag for nine grueling months. Day 171. I've sprouted another finger, counting the one from yesterday. I'm up to 11. As the months of solitude passed, I began to go insane. It seemed my prison cell was getting smaller and smaller. I was quite sure that soon I would be dead. But then, a miracle! There was a light at the end of the tunnel. I rushed to freedom, but suddenly I was ambushed by a mysterious man in white! The man in white. Of course. He must be the hired professional of whom they spoke. He failed to thwart my escape into the outside world. And now, one year hence, he's returning to rectify his mistake and put me back in the womb! 

GUY: I'm Jennifer.
MEG: I'm Meg.
GUY: My God. Your hair is so beautiful. I just want to brush it.
MEG: Really? You want to go throw up?

CHRIS: Hey, Dad, let's go whack some moles!
PETER: Now, Chris, we're not here for fun. Now your mom is counting on us to drop off the deposit. So let's just deliver the check and 
CHRIS: Hong Kong Phooey! Yeah! Come on! Go, yeah! Eat my dust!
PETER: Come on, move it! Oh, man! Chris, this place is great. Pull over, you bastard! Pull over, you bastard! Man.
CHRIS: Hey, Dad, they even got games in the bathroom. Look, I won a balloon! 
PETER: Yeah, way to go, Chris. 

PETER: Where's my watch?
GUY: All right. I won a watch.
PETER: What's The Dukes of Hazzard? That's mine.
GUY: Come on.
PETER: Come on, give that back!
PETER: Give it!
PETER: Come on! Come on!
PETER: Come on! Hands off, fatty!
GUY: Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
PETER: I'm a paying customer.
I got a deposit check for my kid's party right here.
GUY: Mr. Griffin. I am terribly sorry. We're really looking forward to Stewie's special day.
PETER: Now I don't know, after the emotional trauma I've endured on your premises, I think I deserve a little discount.
GUY: Sir, our prices are set by the corporate office.
PETER: Then maybe I'll just take my business elsewhere. Good luck filling our spot by this Saturday.
GUY: I got cash!
GUY: I'll take it!
GUY: Suit yourself.
PETER: Wait. I was just bluffing. My wife has her heart set on this place.
PETER: Chris, this is a big day for you. The day you become the man of the house. Because when we get home, your mother is going to kill me.

STEWIE: So the man in white is coming to put me back in the womb, is he? If I'm to defeat him, I shall require professional forces.
STEWIE: Here we are. Come to Managua, the Mecca of mercenaries. I must prepare for my journey. Let's see. Grenades, mace, baggy full of Cheerios

LOIS: So, are we all set at Cheesie Charlie's?
PETER: Actually, I canceled the reservation.
LOIS: What? How could you?
PETER: Lois, I got a very good reason.
BRIAN: Wait a second. These are always classic.
PETER: Lois, that Cheesie Charlie's is no good. See, it happened like this.

GUY: Welcome to Cheesie Charlie's. Heil, Hitler!
PETER: Actually, the name's Griffin. I was sent by my smart, beautiful, and still sexually appealing wife, Lois.
GUY: Yes. We're all set for your little boy's party.
PETER: I understand we're getting a terrific bargain here.
GUY: Absolutely. The children get to play our games. And if they win enough tickets, they get a prize. They also get food, cake, and your choice of ice-cream flavors vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, or people.
PETER: What was that?
GUY: Chocolate. Give me the check.
PETER: Hold it! Lois may have had her heart set on this place but I love my family too much to risk their lives. Come on, Chris. We're leaving.
GUY: No, you're not!
PETER: Please don't make me angry, pal. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.
LOIS: All right, Peter. That's enough!
BRIAN: Bravo, Peter. You are the Spalding Gray of crap.
LOIS: Do you know how hard it was to get a reservation at Cheesie Charlie's? I had to book it the day of my ultrasound. We'll never find another place in time! For once, it was all gonna be so perfect! PETER: Come on, Lois. It'll still be perfect. We'll give him the best birthday ever right here in the safety and comfort of our own home.
LOIS: Peter, we've been over this.
PETER: Honey, you won't have to lift a finger. I got us a clown, a cake, a petting zoo, a big-ass piñata, the works!
LOIS: You got all those things?
PETER: You bet I did.
LOIS: Wow. Even Cheesie Charlie's doesn't have a petting zoo.
LOIS: Okay, I'll call the parents and let them know the party's here.

BRIAN: You don't have any of those things.
PETER: How do you know?
BRIAN: Face it. You're a terrible liar. Clowns and petting zoos book months in advance. You're gonna have a tough time finding a 

GUY: Hey there, little boy. Are you lost?
STEWIE: Now, listen to me, Jolene. I've got an army to raise, and I must get to Nicaragua. I require a window seat and an in-flight Happy Meal. And no pickles! God help you if I find pickles.
GUY: Henry, I have a lost little boy.
GUY: Hey there, little fella. Why don't you come with me?
STEWIE: Damn you! You're one of them, aren't you? What are they paying you? I'll double it! I'll give you whatever you want! Money! Women! Men?

CHRIS: Dad, what are we doing here again?
PETER: Pigs, Chris. We're getting pigs for Stewie's petting zoo.

MEG: Hi, Mom. This is Jennifer. She gave me a ride home.
LOIS: Meg, you made a friend.
GUY: What a lovely house, Mrs. G. 
GUY: Meg, you didn't tell me your mother was just like Martha Stewart.
LOIS: Oh, no. Once you get to know me, I'm really very nice.
GUY: You know what's nice? Having a friend like Meg. And kittens. It was super swell meeting you. Bye, Meg. Friends forever.
MEG: Forever and ever.
GUY: Wow! What a great yard!

MEG: Guess what, Mom? Jennifer invited me to a party on Saturday.
LOIS: This Saturday? Meg, you can't miss Stewie's first birthday.
MEG: But Mom
LOIS: Meg, our entire family is going to be here for Stewie's party. And that includes you. Understood?
MEG: I can't believe you'd put your family before your own daughter! 

BRIAN: She's a whiny little runt, isn't she?
BRIAN: I said "runt.

PETER: I don't think I'm in the right place. I'm looking for a guy to entertain the kids at my son's birthday.
GUY: Sure. I can do that.
PETER: You do children's parties?
GUY: Yeah. I can do, like, a handstand, and some somersaults maybe.
GUY: I can make pretend like the children are little bugs in my web.

GUY: Do you know your phone number, son? 
STEWIE: The only way you'll get me to talk is through slow, painful torture. And I don't think you've got the grapes!
GUY: It sounds like you don't want to go home. Are you running away?
STEWIE: Stewart Gilligan Griffin runs from nothing!
GUY: You know, son, running away never solves anything. You're getting to be a big boy now. And part of growing up means facing your problems head on.
STEWIE: The ruptured capillaries in your nose belie the clarity of your wisdom. You're saying I must return to face this man in white myself. So be it. As for you, kind sage, I only hope my heartfelt thanks will keep you warm as you spend the next 10 years in frozen carbonite!

BRIAN: Peter, you've only got a couple of hours left. If you pull a party out of your ass, you'll want to stand up.

MEG: My friend Jennifer invited me to hang out with her friends. Can I go?
PETER: I won't fall for this trick. Did you ask your mother?
MEG: Yes.
PETER: Okay, then. Have fun, sweetheart.
MEG: Thanks, Daddy!
PETER: Brian, Stewie's birthday is gonna suck. The only stuff I could get on such short notice was a cake and that big-ass piñata.
BRIAN: I sure hope candy comes out of that.
PETER: Face it, Brian. I'm a bad father, a lousy husband, and a snappy dresser. I'll never be able to face Lois.
BRIAN: The circus is in town. Maybe you could run away and join it.
PETER: The circus!

GUY: Hi. This is the right day, isn't it?
LOIS: Oh, yes. Peter should be back any minute and then we can start the party, I hope.
PETER: Hey, Lois, look. The two symbols of the Republican party an elephant and a big fat white guy who's threatened by change.
LOIS: Peter, this is the most wonderful celebration I could have imagined.
PETER: Yeah. Where's Stewie?
LOIS: He's upstairs, resting up for his big day.
PETER: I'll get him.
LOIS: If you see Meg, tell her to take plenty of pictures.
PETER: Meg's not here. She went to a friend's house.
LOIS: What? She's gonna miss Stewie's birthday.
PETER: I dropped her off an hour ago. Boy, is she gonna be sorry, or what?
LOIS: Peter. How could you let her go?
PETER: What's the big deal? So Meg's with her new friends. They seemed like some nice kids.

GUY: I'm glad you could join us.We're gonna have a great time on our trip.
MEG: A trip? Like to the beach? Because I didn't bring my swimsuit.
GUY: You won't need anything where we're going. Excuse me.I've gotta go mix the punch.

CHRIS: Birthday dude? Do you want some ice cream?
STEWIE: Yes. But no sprinkles! For every sprinkle I find, I shall kill you!

PETER: Come on, Lois. I hate to see you so upset. We got animals. We got clowns. I mean, a party couldn't be any better if Jesus himself showed up.
LOIS: Peter, the circus is terrific. But it's not just Stewie's birthday. We're also celebrating the day our family became whole. Today means nothing if Meg isn't here.

GUY: Meg, you seem sad. Today's a happy day.
MEG: I know. It's just that I really like that guy over there. But he doesn't even know I exist. He must think I'm a total dog.
GUY: That is so not true.
MEG: Then what is it?
GUY: He's a eunuch.
MEG: Really? 
GUY: Sure. All the guys here have been castrated. It's cool.

BRIAN: Where are you off to?
PETER: I gotta make things right for Lois and get this monkey off my back.
PETER: Ow! Knock it off!

STEWIE: All right, men, the man in white is coming to put me back in the womb. Today he comes for me, but tomorrow it could be you or you! I offer you the opportunity to join me in glorious battle. I know that for some of you, your motor skills are not developed. Sadly, you will be used as decoys. But your children's children will know that you fell for a noble cause. Now, who's with me?  
STEWIE: I'll defend myself, and the hell with all of you! There, I've gone and soiled myself. Are you happy now? 

GUY: Our leader is here to take us on our journey!
GUY: My children, rejoice. The hour of transformation is close at hand.
GUY: Who are you? 
GUY: This is Meg, wise one.
GUY: Can she come with us?
GUY: Perhaps. Do you have a mind that seeks enlightenment and a heart that seeks purity? 
MEG: Not really.
GUY: Okay. Are you a confused adolescent desperately seeking acceptance from an undifferentiated ego mass that demands conformity?
MEG: Wow, that sort of sounds more like me.
GUY: Great! Then all you need is a dark-blue jogging suit. Let's see what we have in stock. What are you? About a 9?
MEG: No. A 6.
GUY: Right.
GUY: Dispense the refreshments.


PETER: Meg, there you are.
MEG: Dad, what are you doing here? I'm so embarrassed, I could die!
GUY: Not before the rest of us!
PETER: Meg, your mother wants the family together today.
MEG: It's just Stewie's birthday. So what if I'm not there? Who's gonna remember?
PETER: Your mom will, trust me. She remembers everything. In fact, she always says the best memories she has are when you kids were born. 
PETER: Meg, that's it. This day is more for your mom than it is for Stewie. With all she's given us, she oughta get whatever she wants. And, Meg, today she wants you to be with the family.
MEG: Really? Daddy, you must think I'm the worst daughter ever.
PETER: No you're not, honey. What about that fat girl from the Judds?
MEG: I'm sorry I've been so selfish.
GUY: I miss my mom.
GUY: Me, too. I also miss my nads. Mr. Griffin, can we come to Stewie's party, too?
PETER: Sure. The more the merrier. 
GUY: Meg, you have the coolest family.
GUY: She sure does.
GUY: Here's to family! 
GUY: To family!

PETER: Jeez, look at the time! Come on. Come on, kids. Let's get going.
PETER: Sorry, Meg. It's another bunch of people that'd rather fake death than go to a party with you.

LOIS: I guess there's nothing left but the birthday cake.
MEG: Right here!
LOIS: Meg!
MEG: I'm sorry, Mom.
LOIS: Thank you, Peter.
PETER: No problem. I cannot wait to taste this cake. The guy who sold it to me said it was delicious and erotic.
LOIS: Peter, there's a naked man on this cake. 
PETER: There were only two left. And trust me, you did not want the one of Al Roker with the Hershey Kiss nipples.
LOIS: Gather round, everyone. It's time for Stewie's big moment.

GUY: Hello? Is anybody home?
STEWIE: Greetings, man in white. I've been expecting you.
GUY: Who said that?
STEWIE: Peek-a-boo! I see you! You're getting warmer.
GUY: Where are you? What do you want?
STEWIE: Freedom! What do you want?
GUY: I want to get the hell out of here!
STEWIE: I'm sorry. We're fresh out of that. I'm afraid all that's left is untimely death.
GUY: What the hell is this? 

MEG: These commercials are stupid.
LOIS: They certainly don't make me want a Minto.
BRIAN: Totally ineffective.
PETER: Must kill Lincoln.

STEWIE: A thousand pardons for disrupting your flatware sanitation ritual. But you see, I'm in searing pain!
LOIS: You're just teething, Stewie. It's a normal part of a baby's life.
STEWIE: Very well then, I order you to kill me at once!
LOIS: Honey, I know you're hurting. But Mommy has to clean up the house, all right?
STEWIE: No, it's not all right! For the love of God, shake me! Shake me like a British nanny!

PETER: Oh, man. This is the life. Hand me another one of them Pawtucket Patriots. Guys, I want to say a toast to you, Quagmire, Cleveland
BRIAN: Brian.
PETER: Yeah. If you guys were beers, I would drink every one of you. And I wish you were because we're out.
CLEVELAND: That's funny.
QUAGMIRE: That's even more humorous than that joke you told us last night.
CLEVELAND: Look at the time. I promised Loretta I was gonna trim the hedges and be tender with her.
PETER: Believe me, Cleveland. Our wives need some time off as much as we do. This is when Lois does all those little things that women like to do.

STEWIE: No, you imbecile! That's not talc! That's paprika! Take that!

PETER: Hey, Lois. You've been busy all day. So I took care of dinner.
LOIS: Really?
PETER: All you gotta do is gut it, clean it, scale it, and cook it.
LOIS: I spent all morning cleaning up the house. And in five seconds, you turn it into low tide at the pier.
PETER: Jeez. I'm sorry, honey. I'd help you clean it up. But you know how lousy I am with housework. Remember when I tried doing the laundry?
LOIS: You're right. It's better if I do it.
STEWIE: Damn it to the bowels of bloody hell! 
LOIS: The baby's up. Can you get him?
PETER: Okay. I hope he doesn't need changing. I'm a little gun-shy after what happened last time.
LOIS: All right, I'll do that, too! Can you at least take Chris to his game?
PETER: Jeez, Lois. I spent all morning on a boat drinking beer, telling jokes, and screwing around. How about a little me time?
LOIS: Honey, I'm begging you. Drop Chris off at his soccer game and come right home. I need you to look after Stewie while I'm teaching piano lessons, please!
PETER: All right! You know I spoil you.

CHRIS: Thanks for the ride, Dad.
PETER: All right. Have fun, Chris.

QUAGMIRE: Hey, Petey!
PETER: Quagmire? What are you doing here?
QUAGMIRE: Soccer moms! All right.
PETER: I'd like to hang around with you. But Lois needs me at home.
QUAGMIRE: I got beer.
PETER: Boo, Lois! Yay, beer! 

LOIS: It's okay, Stewie. Where the hell's Peter? That was good, Reuben. Now play Brahms' Lullaby. Lullaby and good night.
STEWIE: Enough! The only thing worse than the wretched pain in my mouth is the excrement spewing from yours!
LOIS: I wish I could make the pain go away sooner. But I can't turn time forward.
STEWIE: Oh, no! Perhaps I can! Of course! I'll simply build a machine that can move time! I shall call it a time machine. E-flat, Salieri! E-flat!

PETER: Go, Chris! Daddy loves you! I mean in a platonic way. I'm married.
GUY: Hand ball! Penalty kick, blue!
GUY: That's the 10th time today! Nice grab, orca. Get Moby Dick off the field before he burps up a license plate!
PETER: Easy, fella. That's my kid. Now apologize.
GUY: Okay. I'm sorry your kid's a brain dead stinking blue cheese feta!

CHRIS: That's it! Way to go, Dad!
GUY: You hit my mom! 
PETER: No, I hit your dad.
GUY: Stand back. Give her some air.
PETER: You mean, Give him some air.
GUY: Call an ambulance. She's going into labor.
PETER: You mean, He's going into labor. Whoops.

PETER: I can't believe I punched a woman.
QUAGMIRE: A pregnant woman.
PETER: I just hope she accepts my peace offering. I sent her a little something for the baby. I would've brought it over myself if I wasn't under house arrest.
CLEVELAND: You're just fortunate this is your first offense, Peter.
PETER: Could've been a lot worse if the cops knew about the other times I broke the law.
QUAGMIRE: Me and Cleveland are gonna amscray.
PETER: Wait. You guys can't leave me here alone.
CLEVELAND: Why don't you come with us?
PETER: I can't leave the premises. They're monitoring my every move.

PETER: I gotta get out of here!
LOIS: There's my little house husband. It's been so wonderful having you home all week.
PETER: Thanks, honey. But I don't know how you stand it here all day. I mean, I'm so bored, I can't even watch TV anymore. All the shows are starting to run together.

GUY: This contains adult content and is brought to you by the letter "H".
GUY: Hello? Son of a bitch. I'm on my way. Some poor bastard got his head blown off down at a place called Hooper's.
GUY: Bert, I wish you wouldn't drink so much, Bert.
GUY: Well, Ernie, I wish you wouldn't eat cookies in the damn bed!
GUY: Bert, you're shouting again, Bert!

PETER: I know you can't understand what I'm going through. All the stuff that makes you happy like cooking and cleaning, is right in the house just waiting for you. You are one lucky.
BRIAN: Stop now.
LOIS: Peter, I don't do those things because I enjoy them. I do them because I love my family.
PETER: Lois loves her family. Lois loves her family. Lois and the family sitting in a tree. See, Lois, the guys would've found that hilarious.
LOIS: Why don't I go buy some groceries and make us a nice romantic dinner? Like when we were dating. That oughta take your mind off the guys.
PETER: It already has. I wonder what the guys are up to?

PETER: Where's the damn pull string? You never know what you're gonna find down here.
GUY: Peter! 
PETER: You're the Pawtucket Patriot.
GUY: Verily. Come hither and give heed.
PETER: Whoa. I don't swing that way, pal. Look, I got a date with my female wife. I just came down to get some beers.
GUY: Why spend time with your wife? If you build a bar in this basement and stock it with plenty of frosty Pawtucket Patriots your friends will come down here for a beer as well.
PETER: Build a bar! That's a great idea. Wait. One last question. If I walk through you, does that mean, like, we've done it?
GUY: Jeez. What's with you and the gay jokes? 

LOIS: Where the hell have you been? We had a date.
PETER: Sorry, honey. I must've lost track of the time. What do you say? You think the guys will like it?
LOIS: This is why you missed our dinner? To make a bar for your friends?
PETER: Yeah, isn't it great? Oh, boy, I feel just like Tim Allen. I build stuff and I have a criminal record.

PETER: Okay, guys. I got another one. What's the difference between pornography and art?
QUAGMIRE: Here it comes.
PETER: A government grant.
CLEVELAND: Peter, you are in the zone.

PETER: You know those little clam cakes you make whenever we have company? I need about a dozen. Actually, better make it like 600.
LOIS: That's it, Peter! I'm not a servant. And I'm through taking care of you and your bar buddies!
PETER: Jeez. Where the hell did that come from?
LOIS: Watch the kids. I'm taking a hot bath.

STEWIE: Put me down, you blunderbuss!
LOIS: He's a little cranky from teething.
PETER: I can fix that. Good God, man! One can only imagine what foul regions that finger has erstwhile probed!
PETER: There you go. My mother used to use whiskey whenever I had a toothache.
PETER: There. How's that feel?
STEWIE: It's delightful.

STEWIE: No, not silicone. Silicon. And the design of the device is quite ingenious if I do say so myself, Misty. What a delightful moniker. You see, Misty my time manipulator employs axioms from the quantum theory of molecular propulsion. I've broken my pencil!
GUY: I have a Barney pen in my purse.
STEWIE: You are spectacular!

LOIS: Chris, what are you doing here?
CHRIS: Sorry, Mom. I'm gonna need to see some ID.
LOIS: Chris, go to your room!

STEWIE: Hello, Mother. Care to partake in one of your oh-so-exhilarating games of peekaboo?
LOIS: Oh, my God! My baby is drunk!
PETER: No, I'm not! Him? Yeah. He's a real lightweight.
LOIS: Meg, take Stewie upstairs.
STEWIE: Show me the way to go home Everybody! I'm tired and I want to go to bed Just the women!

LOIS: Peter, in the 17 years that we've been married I have never been as angry as I What is my piano doing down here?
PETER: It was supposed to be a clam cake buffet, but Never mind.
LOIS: That does it, Peter. Either this bar goes or I do! 
PETER: I haven't even told you the other reason your piano's down here. I wanted you to play it. Like it was an instrument. I'm telling you the truth. Right, guys?
LOIS: Come on! I couldn't.
GUY: Come on!
LOIS: Maybe one song.
PETER: Pretend you like it no matter how bad it stinks.

PETER: You can stop pretending now.
GUY: All right! 
BRIAN: Something troubling you, Peter?
PETER: Nothing. Just all my friends are eye-humping my wife.

LOIS: Wow! It was absolutely amazing. The second that spotlight hit me, I became a whole different person!
STEWIE: Silence, you contemptible shrew!
LOIS: I bet your gums are still sore.
STEWIE: You're so observant, aren't you? Are you a detective? Yes, my gums are sore! Enough of this! I must complete my time machine, move time forward, and end this agony!
CHRIS: Hey, Dad. Mom says she was really on last night.
PETER: Yeah. About that. Lois, see, the guys were just being polite. They thought your singing was too 
LOIS: I was just nervous. Tonight'll be better.
PETER: Tonight? Honey, I don't think anyone's gonna come back tonight.

QUAGMIRE: Now that's a woman! That's a house. That's a fish. That's a bee!

PETER: My house arrest is over, Brian. Round up the guys. Now that I'm a free man, we can do anything we want.
BRIAN: The guys only want to do one thing. And that's ogle your wife. If Lois were my woman, I'd keep an eye on her. Then again, I'm the jealous type.

GUY: Wow! Lois Griffin! I love your act. Nice melons.
PETER: Listen, pal
LOIS: Peter, I'm holding melons.
GUY: And her hooters ain't bad either!
PETER: Now hang on a second there!
LOIS: Peter, I'm holding hooters.
PETER: Sorry.
GUY: No problem. Your wife's hot!
PETER: That's it! Your singing days are over. If I wanted to marry Lola Falana, I would have.

LOIS: Peter, having me sing was your idea in the first place.
PETER: I just wanted to keep my bar. I built that thing so my friends would come to see me, not you. 
LOIS: Is that so? Let me tell you something. I love singing! And I will continue to sing! How dare you upset me this close to showtime!

GUY: Griffin, I got a bone to pick with you.
PETER: Listen, I don't want any more trouble.
GUY: Thanks to your wife my husband hasn't been home all week! That singing hussy is destroying our marriages!
PETER: Yeah, then do something about it. Come to my basement tonight and drag your husbands out of there.
GUY: Maybe we will. Yeah!
 
PETER: Jeez, fella. Can't you take that outside?

LOIS: This next number is dedicated to my very supportive husband, Peter.
PETER: Oh, boy. Lois is pretty pissed, huh?
BRIAN: Yes, your judgment lately has been rather You have crappy judgment anyway.

STEWIE: This is intolerable! This foolishness is preventing me from completing work on Egads! The blueprints for my time machine! Those are for my eyes only!
LOIS: Thank you. Look everyone, Stewie drew a picture for his mommy.
STEWIE: 
GUY: Hold up the picture. Let's see.
STEWIE: No! Nothing to see here.
GUY: How cute. It's a time machine!
STEWIE: No! It's a Blast, what the devil do children draw? It's a pheasant!
GUY: A time machine. Sure. Here's where the flux capacitor goes. I can't wait to build one of these of my own.
STEWIE: I'll not stand idly by while you abrogate my plans. You shall rue this day. Go on! Start ruing!
LOIS: Bye-bye, Stewie. Mommy will be upstairs to kiss you good night.
STEWIE: Burn in hell!
LOIS: Hell. Hell has fire. And you know what else? 

GUY: All right, break it up!
LOIS: What's going on here?
GUY: Your little peep show is over! We're taking back our men!
LOIS: Peep show? I just do this for fun. Look, all day long I scrub and cook and take care of my kids. And nobody cheers. No one even says thank you. But when the band starts playing and the music's flowing through me, I feel, I don't know, special. I guess you all think that's pretty silly.
GUY: Not at all. You didn't tell us that part!
LOIS: Peter, you're behind all this?
PETER: Yes. And you'll never catch me! [Giggles manically] [Screams repeatedly]
LOIS: I bet he also didn't tell you he never helps me around the house. Or takes me out to dinner. Or notices when I get my hair done.
GUY: Oh, no, that's just My husband's the same way.
GUY: So's mine.

STEWIE: They saw my blueprints! What a grievous breach of security! Damn! What do to? Wait for it Yes! Instead of moving time forward to bypass this wretched teething it might just be possible to reverse time's heady flow and undo ever having drawn those damnable blueprints.

LOIS: Peter, when was the last time you told me you love me?
PETER: You know I do.
LOIS: I want to hear it!
PETER: Is that what this is all about?
GUY: Run for your lives! Holy crap! Hot! [Explosion] [Screaming]
LOIS: There's no way out!

STEWIE: At last! My time device is complete! Just one final adjustment. There. Now I shall negate ever having drawn those damnable blueprints.

GUY: Blast! Jeez.
PETER: We're screwed! Look, I promise if we get out of this alive l'm gonna help out around the house and say "I love you" every day.
LOIS: You mean it?
PETER: I'm a changed man, Lois. A better man. And to think, if I hadn't taken Chris to his soccer game I never would've learned this valuable lesson. [People talking backwards] [Mystical instrumental music] [Backwards speech slowing]

LOIS: Honey, I'm begging you. Drop Chris off at his soccer game and come right home. I need you to look after Stewie while I'm teaching piano lessons, please!
PETER: All right! You know I spoil you. My foot! I can't walk! I guess you'll have to take Chris yourself.
STEWIE: [Giggles] My device! My teeth!
GUY: I'm free! Free! I claim this mouth in the name of Incisor! I think not! Bicuspid! We meet again. Have at you! En garde! Shall we bite the tongue then? On three. One, two [Screams] [Theme music] 

Stewie: Oh, Machiavelli! You've told me nothing I don't already know! Ah, Sun Tzu's The Art of War.
Lois: Stewie, those books aren't for babies. Here. Watch the Teletubbies.
Stewie: How dare you! That book may hold the key to my enslaving of all mankind. Ooh, fuzzy.
Teletubby: [giddy laughter] Tickle.
Stewie: God, the more I resist, the more intriguing they become! I can't look away!
Teletubbies: Again! Again!
Stewie: Yes! Yes! Again! Again! Oh, dear God, please once more!
Peter: Sorry, Stewie. A&E Biography is doing the life of the other guy from Wham.
Stewie: I'm free! Free from the spell of those diabolical Teletubbies! Thank you. When the world is mine, your death shall be quick and painless.

Mr. Weed: Attention, please. Tomorrow is softball practice. We have a lot of work to do for Saturday's game. Let's not forget how badly we were humiliated last year by Pawtucket Joke and Novelties.

Pawtucket players: [Raucous laughter]
Peter: [Peter giggles] Look at those morons and their stupid glasses.

Peter: Oh, man. I hate those guys. More than I hate spinach, traffic jams, and the last few years of M*A*S*H. You know, when Alan Alda took over behind the camera and the show got all dramatic and preachy? Huh, am I right? Who's with me?
Mr. Weed: This year we will defeat those Pranksters with our secret weapon Guillermo.
Man: [Screaming]
Mr. Weed: Bravo! I hired Guillermo because I believe he will be an asset to our company on and off the field.

Mr.Weed: You have impeccable credentials. I'm sure I can find a position for you somewhere.

Mr.Weed: Back to work, people.
Peter: Heya, Mr. Weed, I got a great idea for a new line of TV action figures. Facts of Life Transformers, huh? Watch the transformation cute as a button fat as a cow radioactive scorpion. Huh? Watch out, Mrs. Garrett. Here comes Blair!
Mr. Weed: I'll consider it.
Peter: He'll consider it! Hey, I got another one where Natalie's one of those spittin' lizards from Jurassic Park.

Contestant: Pat, I would like to solve the puzzle. Go tuck yourself in.
Pat Sajak: You got it.
Chris: Well, you were close, Dad.
Peter: Yeah. I still can't believe we missed the phrase, My hairy aunt. Come on, Brian. I gotta get to softball practice.
Lois: Practice? I thought we were go next door and welcome our new neighbors.
Peter: Oh, no, no, no. I don't want anything to do with neighbors. Last guy who lived next door borrowed my toaster. Never saw it again.
Lois: Peter, they might be very nice people.
Peter: Very nice people. Yeah, that's what they always say. Then you open up the septic tank and bam! Skeleton city!

Brian: [Panting]
Woman: Pervert!
Brian: Oh, don't flatter yourself, honey. I don't have any sweat glands.

Mr. Weed: Okay, my Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Boys, time for batting practice. Guillermo, you're up. Unfortunately, Johnson isn't here to pitch today. His wife is in labor.
Peter: Oh, what? Is the baby coming out of him? Jeez, I'll pitch.
Brian: Ha. I don't know what's more questionable, your pitching arm or Bill Clinton's integrity.
Peter: Oh, how hard can it be to pitch?
Peter: Okay. Take your base.

Mr. Weed: Somebody call 911. Tell them he is allergic to penicillin and white zinfandel! Idiot! If you don't find a ringer to replace Guillermo, you're fired!
Peter: Oh, man. What am I gonna do if I get fired? I'll have to go back to my old job as a Calvin Klein model.

Girl 1: I don't wanna be just like everyone else.
Guy: But I don't want to be different.
Girl 2: I just want to be.
Peter: What was the name of the bad guy from Tron? Ah, this is gonna drive me nuts!

Lois: Moving is never easy on a family.
Bonnie: Well, we are gonna miss the go-go-go pace of Providence. But with number two on the way, Joe thought it was time to move. And I can't say no to Joe. Ever.
Lois: Oh, Quahog can be pretty exciting, too. Last week, someone lost an eye at Bingo.
Bonnie: Oh, I haven't played Bingo in years!
Stewie: Silence! Ever since you two met, you've done nothing but wax idiotic! I must escape this infernal babble! Aagh!
Bonnie: [Chuckles] What a little explorer.
Lois: Yes. He's so full of wonder.
Stewie: Oh, to be the Lindbergh baby right about now.
Bonnie: Joe, you have to meet our new neighbor, Lois Griffin.
Joe: It's a pleasure, Lois. Who's the little guy?
Lois: This is Stewie. Honey, say hi to Mr. Swanson.
Stewie: You will bow to me.

Meg: Hi. I'm Meg. I live next door.
Kevin: I know. I've admired you in the garden from afar.
Meg: Will you go out with me?
Kevin: I'd love to. [Romantic instrumental music]

Chris: Oh, he's gay.
Meg: You wish! Get out of here, you mouth-breather!

Peter: I'm as good as fired. Where the hell am I gonna find a guy as strong as Guillermo? One time I walked into the locker room, I swear he was bench-pressing Mr. Weed. Ah, great. Lois is getting chummy with the new neighbors.
Brian: I think she wants you to meet them.
Peter: She's always making me be social. Cocktail parties, school functions, that time we planted trees in Jerusalem.

Joe: You must be Peter. Joe Swanson.
Peter: Yeah, yeah. Nice to meet you, Phil. You know, you got a neighbor on the other side of your house, too. So, you know, don't think you always have to bug me.
Joe: [laughs] I'll keep that in mind. Say, do you have a screwdriver I can borrow?
Peter: Man, you neighbors are like viruses. Starts with a screwdriver. Then before you know it, you're using my supermarket, my dry cleaner, and even my postman. Sheesh, can you believe that guy? Do you have a screwdriver I can borrow? What an ass.

Brian: So, Peter, did you find a replacement for the team?
Peter: No. Believe me, I've been looking.
Brian: Gosh, I'd like to help you, Peter. But I've gotta go out in the hall and chew on the back of my ass for about five minutes.

Lois: Oh, Peter, I invited Joe and Bonnie to your game on Saturday.
Peter: Lois, I don't want those people there. See, this is why I ask you to submit everything to me in writing first.
Lois: Bonnie told me Joe is a big baseball fan. He played in college.
Peter: He did?

Peter: Welcome to the neighborhood. Hiya, Joe.
Joe: Peter!
Peter: Oh, don't get up.
Joe: This is a surprise. I kinda thought you didn't like me.
Peter: Oh, what? Because of what I said this afternoon. Oh, no, no, no. See I have that disease where stuff just pops out of your mouth. Go to hell! Go to hell! Whoops. See what I mean?
Joe: Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought maybe I crossed the line when I asked to borrow a screwdriver.
Peter: Are you kidding? You can borrow whatever you want.
Joe: Great. Say, you don't happen to have any picture wire, do you?
Peter: Picture wire? You son of a bitch. Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! There it goes again.
Joe: I don't want to impose.
Peter: No problem. That's what neighbors do. You know what else they do? They play on their neighbor's company softball team, like this Saturday. What do you say, neighbor?
Joe: Sounds fun.
Peter: So much fun it should be illegal like...copyright infringement. [Mickey Mouse voice] See you at the game, Joe. [Cheery instrumental music]

Pawtucket player: Hey, you want a piece of gum?
Quahog player: Oh, thanks.
Pawtucket player: Ha-ha! That was joke gum.
Quahog player: What do you mean?
Pawtucket player: Now you're addicted to heroin.
Quahog player: I'm cold.

Lois: Hey, Peter!
Mr. Weed: It's nice that your family is here, Peter. If your ringer doesn't arrive soon, you can spend every day with them at home.
Peter: He'll be here, Mr. Weed. You should see this guy in action. He can hit, he can throw...

Joe: Peter!
Mr. Weed: What's he doing in a wheelchair?
Peter: Holy crip, he's a crapple!
Mr. Weed: Peter, our new secret weapon is this very attractive paraplegic?
Peter: Okay, Joe, you got me. Rise and shine. Come on. Stand and deliver. Get the hell up.
Joe: Ha, ha, you're a hoot, Peter.

Umpire: Play ball!
Joe: Let's do it!
Peter: I swear I didn't know. Maybe they won't hit a lot of balls to him.
Joe: I got shortstop.

Bonnie: The movers tracked grease all over my carpet. I tried everything to get the stain out.
Lois: What about lemon juice?
Bonnie: What about club soda?
Stewie: What about shutting the hell up?

Meg: Isn't baseball great? [pause] They say baseball's the national pastime. [longer pause] I can't taste salt.

Peter: Ah, crap! Don't hit it to Joe. Please don't hit it to Joe! Please don't hit it to Joe! [Fans cheering]
Umpire: You're out!
Peter: All right, Joe! Way to earn that parking space!
Bonnie: All right!
Lois: Did you see that?
Bonnie: That's my Joe!
Stewie: What the deuce? Half man, half machine. Why, with that technology, I could escape these wretched harridans! Go, cyborg!

Mr. Weed: It all rests on that man's broad, rippling shoulders! [Whooshing]
Mr. Weed: All right, Joe! Run!
Peter: All right, Joe! Come on! Yeah!
Mr. Weed: Hurry! Joe! All right! Yes, vamos!

Player: Let's hear it for Joe!
Peter: Yeah, let's hear it for the guy who found Joe! Yay. Okay. Huh.

Joe: That's finger suckin' good, huh? It's an old policemen's recipe. Eat up, everyone. Tonight my wife won't be the only one enjoying a pig in a blanket.
Bonnie: Joe, you're so funny.
Joe: They love that one down at the precinct.
Peter: Ah, this sucks, Brian. Joe is stealing my thunder.
Joe: Hey, everybody! Time to limbo!
Brian: Face it. He's the life of the party.
Peter: Ah, yeah? I'll show you who's the life of the party. Hey, look! Hey! I fell in the pool with my clothes on! How hilarious is that? That is so Peter Griffin. Guys? Huh? Guys?

Joe: That's my idea.
Mr. Weed: Peter, come here.
Peter: Oh, finally. A little recognition.
Mr. Weed: Joe has the most wonderful idea.
Joe: Hey, I just suggested a line of handi-capable toys. You know, to show kids the fun side of being physically challenged!
Peter: Oh, yeah, that's what kids want to play with. Yeah. A Beanie Baby in a bubble. What about my idea? Come on! Tootie morphs into a stink bug.
Mr. Weed: Joe, you're exactly the kind of man we need at our company. Peter, make yourself useful. Go get Joe a drink.

Peter: Jeez, first he takes my friends. Then he takes my job. But the way I wear my hat.... No. No. He can't take that away from me.

Stewie: You! How came you by this metal construct? I demand to know who made you!
Lois: Stewie, it's not polite to point. I'm so sorry.
Joe: That's okay, Lois. He's just curious about the chair. About 10 years ago, I was investigating a robbery at an orphanage. It was Christmas Eve and some presents had been stolen. [Tense instrumental music] [Grunting]

Joe: Reach for the sky, dirtbag! All right, pal! You've stolen your last Christmas. [70s cop show fight music]
The Grinch: You think you have won, you think all is well, but kiss my green ass, I shall see you in hell! [Screaming]
Joe: Are you Timmy? Merry Christmas, Timmy.

Stewie: Oh, enough! If you won't share your technological schemata with me peaceably, I shall take the information from you by force!
Lois: Well, looks like you have a fan.

Peter: Come on. Let's get out of here.
Joe: Peter, you can't leave.
Peter: Sorry, I promised the wife and kids I'd take them on a dream vacation to Hawaii, right now. Say aloha, kids.
Meg: What are you talking about? We want to hear more of Mr. Swanson's stories.
Chris: He's cool, Dad. He killed a guy.
Joe: Well, technically, he was killed by the state, but funny story-he did curse my name just before the injection.

Lois: Peter, what's the matter with you?
Peter: Why are you guys making such a big deal over Joe? You're not supposed to admire wheelchair people. You're supposed to feel sorry for them. Jeez, when did it become okay to be handicapped?
Lois: Don't talk like that! He's a remarkable man, and the rest of your family adores him.
Peter: Well, fine, then why don't you all marry him? And if he's so remarkable, let's see him do this. Hey, look at me, I'm walking. Ooh, I'm a remarkable man.

Peter: Well, look who finally came home. Jeez, I thought you were gonna spend all night over at Joe's.
Brian: I could have. That man has got magic fingers. He found this one spot behind my ear-forget about it. I thought my leg was never gonna stop.
Peter: I don't believe this. My whole family worships the ground that guy can't walk on.
Brian: Well, it's not too hard to see why. I mean, the guy's a hero; he makes the world a better place.
Peter: Hey, hey, hey, I've done lots of things to help people. Remember that time I sang to the kids down at the Sunday school?
Brian: Yes, and you forgot the words. No, no, no, it's not the same thing. Joe puts himself in real danger, every day.
Peter: [sighs] You're right. I'll never be that kind of hero...unless I put myself in real danger, too, for my family's sake!
Brian: Why are the pretty ones always so dumb?

Stewie: [Screaming][Cat squealing]
Dispatch radio: We hava a gang shooting on Third and Main. Three wounded, one dead.
Brian: Is it me, or is rap music just getting lazier?
Peter: No, no. It's my new police scanner. This hero thing is gonna be easy once I find the right crime.
Dispatch radio: We have a domestic disturbance...
Peter: Boring!
Dispatch radio: Report of a stabbing at...
Peter: Blah blah blah blah blah.
Dispatch radio: All units! All units! A major bank robbery is in progress at Quahog Bank and Trust. Suspects are armed and extremely dangerous.
Peter: Perfect! Where's Lois and the kids?
Brian: Uh, over at Joe's.
Peter: Well, go fetch 'em. They're about to see a real hero in action. To the Batcave!

Peter: Uh-oh. [Bats screeching]
Peter: Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

Peter: You thought Joe was something. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Lois: Peter, what's the big rush?
Peter: All right, you guys wait right here. Daddy's gonna make a little withdrawal.

Robber 1: Let's give Tammy a round of applause. This was her first robbery and she was very brave. [applause]
Robber 2: Now before we go...
Girl: No, don't go.
Robber 2: Oh, princess, we have to.
Peter: I hope you brought your striped pajamas, boys. 'cause there's a five-year sleepover at the big house, and you're invited.
Robber 2: You'll never take us alive! [Gunshots]

Peter: Oh, Lois and the kids should be in here to see this.
Brian: Yes. It's going very well.

Meg: Mom, what do you do when you like a boy but he doesn't even notice you?
Chris: Meg loves Kevin.
Meg: Shut up, you big sack of dog vomit!
Lois: Meg, you're a sweet, lovely girl. He'll come around.
Meg: Such a mom answer.
Lois: Well, have you tried showing off the goods? How's that for a mom answer?
Meg: Creepy.
Lois: Oh, I saw some cute dresses down the street. If nothing else, it'll make you feel better. Come on, you guys.

Brian: Well, if you want to be a hero, now might be a good time.
Peter: Jeez, Brian, this isn't what I was expecting. I thought being a hero would be all fun and games.
Robber 2: Come on. Let's get out of here. [police sirens]
Robber 1: Oh, perfect.
Robber 2: We got hostages in here, so don't try anything funny!
Peter: Don't worry, Brian. I got a plan.
Brian: Oh, good. I was afraid you were just gonna improvise.
Peter: Oh. Well, actually, I was gonna use the little girl as a human shield and run like hell. But improvise, that'll be easier on my back.

Peter: Okay, in this improv, Tammy and the short robber are husband and wife. Okay. And where are we?
Man 1: A bar!
Man 2: A pet store!
Old woman: Guadalajara, Mexico!
Peter: Okay, okay. I heard pet store. And I'm the gruff but lovable owner. All right. Begin. Hello, married couple. I see you found a puppy.
Robber 1: Yeah. His name is Sparky.
Peter: Well, before you take Sparky home, let me check him for worms. Okay, drop it! All right, you guys. Let's get out of here.

Cop: All right, stand back!

Peter: Whoa, whoa. Hang on, hang on. Sorry, no one can leave. Listen, the whole reason I saved you guys today was so I could be a hero. See, this wheelchair guy moved in next door and he can do all these great things and, well...
Girl: Your family idolizes the lousy cripple and not you?
Peter: That's right! How'd you know?
Old woman: We've all been there.

Chris: Cool! The bank is getting jacked!
Lois: Officer, my husband's in there! Can you tell me if he's okay?
Cop 1: What's he look like?
Lois: He's wearing a white, collared shirt, kind of big, with glasses.
Cop 2: I got him.
Lois: Oh, thank God.
Cop 1: Take him out.
Lois: No!

Peter: Hey, there's my family.
Robber 2: I just want you to know I rob banks because a deaf man stole my job at the phone company. So, if anyone's gonna bust me, I'm glad it's you. [Tense instrumental music]
Peter: But...but, I was gonna be a hero.
Robber 2: Nobody's going anywhere!

Bonnie: Joe, it's Peter! He's in trouble!
Tom Tucker: A failed robbery at Quahog Bank and Trust has led to a terrifying hostage situation. [pause] That's right. A hostage situation.
Joe: I gotta go.
Bonnie: I know.

Robber 1: All right, if we want the cops to take us seriously, we have to waste a hostage. But who?
Peter: Uh, excuse me. Shouldn't that be "whom"?
Robber 1: Okay, you.
Peter: Crap!

Joe: This is Police Lieutenant Joe Swanson. I know we can work this out together.
Peter: Aw, jeez, not him again. I hope this place isn't wheelchair accessible.

Lois: Bonnie, it's Peter.
Bonnie: Don't worry. Joe's an excellent negotiator. I was a virgin when we met. It took him three hours.

Meg: I can't believe my dad is in there. [pause] This'll probably scar me for the rest of my life. [pause] I got a new dress.
Cop 2: Try talking about him.
Meg: So do you like music?
Kevin: Oh, yeah! I played guitar in a band before we moved. But it interfered with my studies. What do you listen to?
Meg: You first.
Kevin: I'm into Garbage, Phish, Blur. My parents don't like me listening to that stuff. But I do anyway, because I am not a robot!!! I also like Radiohead.

Joe: And even though society has turned its back on you, I promise you there are people who care. And you know what? I'm one of them.
Robber 2: He sure gets it.
Robber1: Maybe he's right. We can make a new start.
Peter: Oh, come on, guys. Don't let him sweet talk you like that. Wait, wait, wait. You can't leave now. I'm supposed to be the hero here. Wait! Can you let me pistol-whip you a couple times for the camera? Dang, stupid robbers with your guns and your, your make-out parties. [Crowd cheering] [Cops cheering]

Stewie: Aha! Excellent! They detached the human component from the machine. Machine, I am your new master and I order you to go! Engage! Blast! Must be some kind of proprietary command system. Now on the Russian MiG, it's next to the altimeter.
Lois: There you are. I can't turn my back on you for a second.
Stewie: Augh! One day I shall unlock the secret of that device. And when I do, Mother, victory shall be...
Lois: Peter, you had us so worried. What on earth were you trying to prove?
Peter: I'm sorry. Joe is a great guy. I guess I was just tired of him being your hero.
Lois: Peter, Joe is a hero, but he's not our hero. You are.
Peter: Really?
Lois: Yeah. You're always right there on the couch for us, making us laugh when we're upset. Changing the channel when something boring comes on. Eating the last slice of pizza so the rest of us don't fight over it.
Meg: Yeah, Daddy. And if you hadn't pulled this stunt I never would have learned how to manipulate Kevin.
Chris: And when the kids at school see us on TV, they'll think you're a total psycho. And I can say, That psycho is my dad!
Michelle Kwan: And I would never have won the silver in Nagano, if you hadn't driven me to the ice rink every morning at 6:00 a.m.
Peter: I guess being a hero isn't always about saving lives and catching bad guys. It's also about just being there for the people you love.

Old Woman: Help! Someone just stole my purse!
Peter: Who cares? I don't even know you.

Stewie: Oh, blasted matriarch! She has failed once again to replenish this frigid box with potations. I'll give her a piece of my mind at once! Agh! Damn it! Now look here, you....oh, my God! [Dramatic instrumental music]

Lois: Now you shouldn't be frightened, Stewie. What you saw was actually a very beautiful thing.
Stewie: Evidently, madam, you and I differ greatly in our conception of beauty. What I just witnessed was ghastlier than a thousand ghouls!
Lois: Stewie, mommies and daddies like to hug each other that way. In fact, sweetie, that's sort of how you were created.
Stewie: Ah! That is a vile and odious lie! How dare you fill my head with such loathsome propaganda? Get out, you horrid woman! Get out!
Lois: Okay, honey. I'll go get your teddy bear.

Stewie: [moaning]
Brian: Oh, good Lord, you saw them together, didn't you? You know the tub where you take your little baths? They've done it there, too.
Stewie: [Exclaiming]

Scout leader: What in the name of our Christian God? You're out of the semicircle! All Scouts have to sit in the semicircle!
Chris: Why?
Scout leader: Why? Why? Saunders, tell him why!
Saunders: Because it's Rule 142-B!
Scout leader: Because it's Rule 142-B! Good job, Scout. Now drop and give me 20!
Saunders: Thank you, sir!
Scout leader: Ladies, this Saturday there will be a soapbox derby, as a reward for all your obedience. [Scouts barking] [50s style music]

Richie: Mom, Dad, I really like Potsie.
Mrs. Cunningham: Why not, dear? Potsie's a very nice boy.
Richie: No, Mom. I mean, I really like Potsie.
Mr. Cunningham: We heard you the first time, son. You have a homosexual attraction to Potsie.

Brian: You have anything on that remote lower than mute?

Peter: I got a surprise for you, Chris. Aw, jeez, it'll have to wait. This is the one where the Fonz goes,"Heyyyyyyy!"
Fonzie: Heyyyyyyy!
Peter: [Laughing] Take that, 1950s society! Okay, let's go.

Peter: Chris, this is the speed machine that's gonna win you the soapbox derby.
Chris: But, Dad, I was supposed to build it myself. It's a rule.
Peter: Ah, come on. Rules were made to be broken. [grunts] Here, let me show you the turbo booster.
Chris: Uh, Dad, what would you say if I told you I didn't want to be in the Scouts?
Peter: I'd say Come again? And then I'd laugh because I said come. But thank God that's not the case. You're a Scout. And you know what that means? That means I love you.

Chris: Meg?
Meg: Chris, get out of here! You're not allowed in my room.
Chris: I thought that was just when you were asleep.
Meg: What do you want?
Chris: Meg, I don't want to be in the Scouts anymore. I just want to draw. Listen, I was kinda hoping you could tell Dad. But try and open with a joke.
Meg: Tell him yourself.
Chris: I can't. I don't want to disappoint him again. You remember what happened when he tried to sneak me into the County Fair?

Peter: One, please.
Chris: [sneezes]
Ticket Salesman: Wait a second! Your ass just sneezed! And horses can't talk! No, no, no! Nothing about this adds up at all!

Meg: Okay, look. Dad is really easy. All you have to do is sit on his lap, give him a big kiss on the cheek, look him right in the eye, and he's butter.

Peter: What the hell?
Chris: Dad, the Scouts are no fun. And I...oh, wait a minute. [kisses Peter]
Peter: Chris, I am going to stand up, walk out of this room and we will never speak of this again. [walks out of room]
Chris: [Moans]

Pops: Speed, I do not think you should be in this race! Ha-ha! The Mach 5 is not ready! Ha-ha!
Speed Racer: But Pops, I must be in this race! Ha-ha!
Pops: Very well. But I am not really your father! Ha-ha!
Speed Racer: [Exclaiming]

Scout leader: Okay girls, get ready... [Scouts making revving sounds]
Scout leader: ...get set...
Scout leader: Do not go until I wave my flag. I can't stress that enough. I'll wave it once just to show you how it looks.
Chris: Look out!
Scout leader: Griffin is disqualified! Griffin is disqualified! [grunting]

Scout leader: Your boy is out of the Scouts!
Peter: Jeez, who died and made you President Nixon?
Scout leader: Look, it's been two years! Your idiot son hasn't earned a single merit badge. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to administer some spankings.
Peter: Ah, come on. Give him a little more time, huh?.
Scout leader: All right, all right! You've got three days to earn a badge!
Peter: Three days! That's tomorrow! We gotta get going!

Lois: Stewie, look what Mommy made for dessert.
Stewie: Ooh, Jell-O. How exotic! I feel like I'm on the deck of the QE II.
Peter: Me and Chris will take ours to go. We've only got one more night to get that badge.
Chris: Uh, Dad, maybe we should just give up. I mean, we tried everything.
Peter: We almost got that one for insect study. [Peter and Chris hiding in shrubbery]

Peter: Look, Chris. It's a whole family of WASPs.
WASP Father: My, Margaret. What a sub-par ham.
WASP Mother: Perhaps I can't bake a ham. But what I can cook up is a little grace and civility at the table.
WASP Father: Patty, did you know that your mother is a whore?

Lois: I think it's great that you and Chris've been spending so much time together. But he's the one who should be earning that badge.
Peter: Hey, where do you get off telling me how to raise my son? Oh. Oh, right. Okay. We'll try it your way, honey. [Laughing nervously] Hey, there's my Scout!
Chris: Not anymore, Dad. I'm out. They made me turn in my uniform and everything.
Peter: What? Those bastards! Don't you worry, Chris. I'll get you back in!
Chris: It's okay, Dad. I'm not really...
Peter: Don't take no for an answer, Chris. You're a Griffin. And a Griffin never knows when to stop.

Peter: Clear! Clear!
Victim: [Gasping] You-you saved my life, Doctor!
Peter: Clear!

Peter: I'm calling that damn troop leader right now. We're going over his head. Straight to the Youth Scout head office in New York. Pack your bags, you guys! The Griffins are hitting the Big Apple!
Speed Racer: Ha-ha! Did you hear? The Griffins are going to New York! Ha-ha!
Pops: This does not affect us at all. Ha-ha!
Speed Racer: Ha-ha!

Meg: I can't believe we're actually going to New York.
Chris: Uh, Dad, you don't really have to do this.
Peter: Yes, I do. No boy of mine is gonna get booted out of the Scouts.
Chris: [moans]

Stewie: What the hell do you think you're doing?
Lois: Strapping you in, honey, so you don't get hurt.
Stewie: So I don't get hurt. That's the best you can come up with, you dull-witted termagant?
Lois: I brought your Raffi tape.
Stewie: ...Play Wheels on the Bus and get the hell out of my sight.

Meg: Where's Brian?
Peter: Hey, aren't you coming?
Brian: Thanks but no thanks. I've been to New York. It's like Prague sans the whimsy.
Lois: Will you be okay by yourself?
Brian: Oh, I think I'll manage.
Peter: All right, you guys. We're off! Those Scouts are never gonna know what hit them. [backs into neighbor's car] And neither will that guy. [Tires squealing]

Lois: Okay. I'm thinking of a movie.
Meg: Is it an action movie?
Lois: No.
Chris: Is it a musical?
Lois: No.
Peter: Is it a good movie?
Lois: It has its moments.
Peter: Cool Runnings.
Lois: Right!

Lois: Peter, we're lost. Would you please ask for directions?
Peter: We are not lost. And even if we were, you know I can't ask a human being for directions.
Lois: Why not?
Peter: Because I'm a man. Jeez, haven't you ever seen a stand-up comedian, Lois?
Chris: Dad, maybe we should go home.
Peter: No way, son. We came to get you back into the Scouts. And that's exactly what we're gonna do. [Gurgling]
Lois: What was that?
Peter: Nothing. [Gurgling]
Lois: Peter, the car is making funny noises.
Peter: You're wrong again, Lois. That wasn't the car. Although you were right about that prune smoothie. [shudders]
Lois: Are you okay?
Peter: I'll be fine. I just have to concentrate on driving. [Alarming instrumental music]

Meg: Wow! An Indian casino!
Peter: Yeah. I gotta find me the stink lodge! [Moaning] [Thrilling instrumental music]
Peter: Come on, you guys. No time to lose! Hold it. Hold it! Hold it! [Moaning]

Indian robot: How! And welcome to our casino, palefaces. Feel free to visit gift shop in lobby and restaurant on second floor.
Indian Robot 2: Do you have reservations?
Indian Robot: Only about the veal!
Robots: [Laughing]

Peter: Aw, jeez, this is gonna be a photo finish, Lois![Moaning]

Lois: I'm gonna ask someone for directions. Meg, watch Stewie. Excuse me. Can you tell me how to get to New York?
Sees You Coming: Well, sure. But what's your hurry, ma'am? Don't you want to play a little first?
Lois: Thank you. But I really don't approve of, you know, gambling.
Sees You Coming: Well, technically, it's not really gambling. It's just us trying to rebuild our shattered culture after you raped our land and defiled our women.
Lois: Well, as long as you're not using it for firewater.

Carrot Scalp: Look, a "bow" tie. [Singing] I'm David "Bow"ie. "Bow" Derek!
Stewie: Oh, very funny! Now tell the one that doesn't suck! [Laughter and applause]
Stewie: Oh. thank you. Thank you. Yes, yes. And what's the deal with airline food?

Peter: Hey, thanks, "Watches You Pee." Where's your mother?
Chris: Over there.
Peter: I didn't know you knew how to play poker.
Lois: Yeah.
Peter: How you doing?
Lois: Yeah.
Peter: That's good, honey. Let's go.
Lois: Yeah. It's funny. I never knew video poker could be so much fun. You win a few hands and all those lights go off. And you just feel so good inside.
Peter: Yeah, gambling is great. No question about it.
Lois: It felt so good. I just-I kept putting my money in. And before I knew it, I'd lost $40. I'm so embarrassed.
Peter: Ah, that's okay. As long as you learned your lesson.
Lois: Oh, I did, Peter...for a couple of minutes. Then.... This is so silly. I started playing again.
Peter: Jeez, I could swear I parked here.
Lois: Yeah, you did. But here's the really silly thing, Peter. I sort of bet our car.
Peter: [Exclaiming] Okay, I'm not panic. I just need to go back in the casino and find a high roller who'll pay $1 million to sleep with my wife.
Lois: What? That's ridiculous!
Peter: C'mon, Lois, these people took $24 for the island of Manhattan. They have no idea what things are worth!
Meg: Nice going, Mom. I finally get my driver's license and you lose the car to a poker machine. How ironic.
Peter: Hey, don't talk about your mother that way. She is not an i-ron. Now, c'mon, we gotta figure out a way to get to New York and get Chris back into the Scouts.
Chris: But Dad...
Peter: I got it. I'll just get Brian to wire us some money.

Brian: [laughing]
Ann Romano: Damn it, Julie! I am not shacking up with my boyfriend. I am just going away for the weekend.
Schneider: Yeah. All the away. [TV audience laughing]
Brian: [Hooting] Oh, damn, Schneider! What won't you say?

Peter: No answer at the house. You didn't bet that, too, did you?
Lois: Oh, I'm sorry, Peter. I feel so foolish. It just seemed like such a good cause. Everyone in the tribe gets a share in the casino's profits.
Peter: What did you just say?
Lois: I'm sorry, Peter.
Peter: After that.
Lois: I feel foolish.
Peter: After that.
Lois: Casino's profits.
Peter: Before that.
Lois: Everyone in the tribe.
Peter: Now the whole thing.
Lois: Everyone in the tribe gets a share in the casino's profits?
Peter: That's it! Let's go!

Leonard Cornfeathers: I'm sorry to hear about your misfortune. But we're not allowed to return gambling losses.
Peter: Well, I think you can make an exception in our case, Lenny. See, I'm an Indian, too.
Leonard Cornfeathers & Lois: Excuse me?
Peter: You heard me. I'm a member of your tribe. And that entitles me to a share of your wampum, kemo sabe.
Leonard Cornfeathers: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second. Not so fast. Tell me of your history, of your past.
Peter: Oh, I come from a long line of...you people. My great-grandfather's name was Jeep Grand Cherokee. I mean, Chief Grand Cherokee. He was a rainmaker.
Chief Grand Cherokee: [Native singing]  I'm so happy doing the neutron dance [native singing] I'm just burning doing the neutron dance 
Peter: And he also killed a bunch of Krauts at Wounded Knee. So are you gonna give me back my car, or what?
Leonard Cornfeathers: I have to confer with the council of the elders. You wait right here.
Lois: Are you nuts, Peter? You'll never get away with this.
Peter: Why not? I've fooled people before. You remember that time I pretended to be gay?
Lois: Peter, there is no way they're gonna believe you're an Indian.
Indian: He's an Indian, all right.
Leonard Cornfeathers: How do you know?
Indian: I can tell.
Leonard Cornfeathers: Oh, you think everyone's an Indian. He could just be another mooch trying to get a cut of our profits.
Frank: Maybe we can put him through a test, you know? Like a really impossible stunt to prove he's the real deal.
Leonard Cornfeathers: Hey, way to think outside the box, Frank.

Leonard Cornfeathers: To prove you are truly a member of our tribe, you must go on a vision quest. Do you know what a vision quest is?
Peter: ...Of course I do. I'm an Indian. But why don't you explain it to my wife? She's a little slow in the head.
Leonard Cornfeathers: A vision quest is a sacred spiritual journey. Your husband must go out in the wilderness without food or water.
Frank: Or shoes.
Leonard Cornfeathers: Yeah. Or shoes. He must remain there until he can communicate with nature. He must hear the wisdom of the rocks and trees. And then his guiding spirit must appear to him and reveal a great personal truth. And it's gotta be a real vision. We're Indians. We're gonna know if he's lying.
Indians: [Howling ominously]
Leonard Cornfeathers: [Laughing] Sucker.

Lois: Peter, please don't do this. We can buy another car. I'll give extra piano lessons on Sundays.
Peter: Come on, Lois. All I gotta do is have a spiritual vision. I've had one before.

Peter: Oh, my God. Brian. There's a message in my Alpha Bits. It says Ooooo.
Brian: Peter, those are Cheerios.

Leonard Cornfeathers: You must begin your journey now.

Meg: Now's your chance to be alone with Dad.
Chris: Are you nuts? I'm not attracted to Dad.
Meg: Tell him you don't want to be in Scouts.
Chris: Oh. Thanks, Meg.
Meg: Yipes.

Chris: Dad, can I come?
Peter: How about it, Lenny?
Leonard Cornfeathers: What the hey? The more the merrier. Now get the hell out of here, you nut, and go have yourself a spiritual vision. [Mysterious instrumental music]

Peter: Oh, water! Thank God!
Chris: Dad, I'm hungry. Are we gonna die?
Peter: Of course not. This isn't the first time I've had to find my own food in the wild.

Little Red Riding Hood: [humming]
Peter: [shouting]
Little Red Riding Hood: [screams]
Peter: [Laughing] Dumb broad. [Screaming]

Lois: They've been gone for over six hours. How long do these vision quests usually take?
Leonard Cornfeathers: Huh? Well, you know, it varies, you know?. It depends on the person's age, and height, and...sign.
Lois: You have no idea, do you?
Leonard Cornfeathers: Of course I...no.
Lois: Well, then, why would you send my husband and son out into the wilderness without any food or supplies?
Leonard Cornfeathers: 'Cause we really like your car?
Lois: [sighs]
Stewie: They're dead, you know.

Peter: Must eat. Haven't snacked in hours. Can't feel my eyes. Wonder if club-footed midgets get justice in heaven.

Tree 1: Hot enough for you?
Peter: What?
Tree 1: I say, Hot enough for you?
Peter: Yeah. I guess. Oh, my God! I'm communicating with nature! Hey, Tree, if one of you falls and there's no one around, do you make a noise?
Tree 2: Are you kidding? Scott fell last week. He hasn't shut up about it since.
Scott: Sure. Stand there and bitch! But would any of you take the time to help me?
Tree 3: Ooh, ooh, I'm playing the world's smallest violin, Scott.

Fonzie: Hey, yo, Griffin!
Peter: The Fonz!
Fonzie: Heyyyyyy!
Peter: What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be in the middle of a Tuscadero sandwich?
Fonzie: Yeah. But I'm your spiritual guide, see? And I want to lay a little personal truth on you. Now, Mr. C was like a father to me. And he always listened, you know? And Griffin, right now, your son needs you to listen to him. Whoa!
Peter: Sure. Whatever you say. Uh, Fonzie? There's something I always wanted to ask you. You were with a lot of girls. Did you ever get a sexual disease?
Fonzie: Herpes twice. And the clap. Heyyyyyy!

Chris: Uh, hey, Dad? Can I talk to you?
Peter: Not now, son! Oh, uh, sure. Go right ahead.
Chris: I don't want to be a Scout, Dad. I just don't have fun there. I guess you're pretty disappointed in me.
Peter: Well, yeah!
Chris: Dad, this is what I really like to do.
Peter: What? You want to draw? Aw, jeez, son, why don't you just stick a knife in my heart? I mean, so, you drew this?
Chris: Yeah. I know they suck.
Peter: well, not all of them. Some of these look pretty good.
Chris: Really?
Peter: Yeah! I didn't know anyone in this family had any talent. Well, except for that one thing your mother does.
Chris: You mean play the piano?
Peter: No, no. She.... Yeah. I probably don't say this often enough. But I'm really proud of you, Chris.
Chris: Thanks, Dad.

Lois: Peter? Chris? Oh, thank God. Are you okay?
Peter: Fantastic, Lois! I saw my guiding spirit.
Leonard Cornfeathers: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a second! You had a vision?
Peter: It was amazing! I spoke to the trees. And I saw the Fonz.
Lois: Really? What's the Fonz like? I bet he's stuck up.
Peter: A little. But thanks to him, me and Chris have never been closer.
Leonard Cornfeathers: Oh, I want a spiritual vision, too! Man! I guess we've lost touch with our noble roots. I mean, sure this casino's brought our tribe money and prosperity. But what is the price of our souls?
Frank: $6 million a week.
Leonard Cornfeathers: That sounds about right. Hey, you know what, take your crappy car back. Come on, boys. Let's go hit the buffet.
Peter: All right! We did it! Let's get the hell out of here.

Stewie: Stupid, greedy savages!
Lois: Stewie, that's a terrible thing to say. This one particular tribe has lost their way. But most Native Americans are proud, hardworking people who are true to their spiritual heritage. They are certainly not savages.
Stewie: That's funny, Mother. Just this morning you said they were lazy, like the dirty Mexicans. Just kidding. The Mexicans are a clean and industrious people with a rich cultural heritage.
Meg: Yeah. Not like those dumb, gargantuan Swedes. Actually, the Swedish people run the gamut from very short to tall. And did you know that Sweden gave us the brilliant inventor, Alfred Nobel? 
Peter: Yeah. Which is more than we ever got from those freeloading Canadians. [pause] Canada sucks.

Peter: Come on, everyone. That Eight is Enough reunion show is about to start.

Tom Bradford: Oh, Mary, have you seen Nicholas?
Mary Bradford: He's up in his room sulking, Dad.
Nancy Bradford: Yeah. He's still upset because Abby threw out his baseball cards.
Tom Bradford: Oh, well, maybe I should make him a sandwich.
All: [Laughing]
Nancy Bradford: Oh, Dad. That's your solution to everything.
Nancy Bradford: [crying]
Mary Bradford: Dad! Dad!
Tom Bradford: What?
Mary Bradford: Eight is enough.
All: [Laughing]
Tom Bradford: You know, I love you girls.

Stewie: Splendid. That hausfrau's cheap rayon blouses will make a serviceable parachute should I need to abandon my jet in mid-flight. Once it's built, of course. Rupert, did you call that engineer at Lockheed yet? No, of course you didn't, you worthless little.... There! See what you made me do? Do you think I enjoy hitting you? Well, actually, I do. I enjoy it so much I'm going to do it again!

Lois: Oh, Stewie! My clothes are not for you to play with, understand? Thanks for telling me, Brian. I don't know what we'd do without you.
Stewie: I'm on to you. Oh, yes! Your pathetic attempts to hinder my work have not gone unnoticed. You prance about this house like the cock of the walk. But will you be prancing when...when...when there's nothing to prance about? Hmm? Will you be prancing then?
Brian: Oh, you just want to eat him up.

Meg: It is so hot out there!
All: How hot is it?
Meg: I don't know. Like, around 98, 99.
Peter: I don't get it.
Meg: I think I'm a little sweaty.

Stewie: You! You seem to know all the players in this poorly-acted farce. What do they call that one?
Chris: That's Meg, dude. You know that.
Stewie: Meg! You vile-smelling girl, you're not to touch any of my things! You understand me? Dirty, dirty girl.

Tom Tucker: Finish your oatmeal, son.
Jake Tucker: Why bother? I'm just a freak! A freak!

Diane Simmons: Meanwhile, here at home, Quahog remains in the sweltering grip of a freak heat wave.
Tom Tucker: I don't think you should use the word freak. Some people might find it offensive. We're all a little different, Diane. Each of us.
Diane Simmons: Good point, Tom. We're even feeling the effects of this heat wave here in our studio. [Sneezing] Freak. So stay inside and stay cool.

Meg: I think I saw one of her nipples!
Lois: Chris, that's a terrible word! Nipple. I'll chalk that up to the heat, mister.

Stewie: I say, am I to strut about all day like a beggar child on the streets of Calcutta? Fetch me something linen to throw on before I call Child Services!
Lois: Please don't threaten Mommy. She's very hot.

Meg: Chris, you're hogging up all the fans!
Chris: Yeah, well, you're hogging up all the ugly!

Peter: Check this out, you guys. The Rhode Island Dog Show Championship is in Quahog this year! First prize is $500!
Lois: Really? You know, if you won, we could use that money for a new air conditioner.
Meg: Hey, Brian. You could win for sure. You could do your impression of a barbershop quartet.
Brian: Uh, sorry. I don't do dog shows. It's not my thing.
Peter: Come on, Brian. All you gotta do is a few simple commands. And maybe a trick or two. It'll be like taking candy from a baby.
Meg: Please, Brian.
Brian: I don't know. I mean I don't even know where my papers are. Can't you get the money some other way?
Peter: Believe me, I've been trying. That's why I went on that game show.

Alex Trebek: For $800, this chemical dye is found in over 95% of all cosmetic products.
Peter: Diarrhea.
Audience: [Laughter]
Peter: What? Oh, oh, sorry, sorry. What is Diarrhea?

Peter: Come on, Brian. We really need a new air conditioner.
Brian: [Groaning]

Peter: Okay, let's go over the commands. Sit. Good. Roll over.
Brian: Peter, I'm already shvitzing like crazy here. Let's call it a night, huh?
Peter: Look, do you want to win this thing or not? We haven't even talked about how you're gonna wear your ears. You know, 'cause I was thinking up.
Brian: I need a cocktail.

Lois: Don't push too hard, Peter. You gotta take Brian's feelings into consideration. After all, it's only a dog show.
Peter: Lois, honey, I love you, but you're sucking all the energy out of the room.

Brian: Come.
Lois: I got you a little something, you know, for the show. It's Italian. Do you like it?
Brian: Oh, it's exquisite.
Lois: It's not for every day.
Brian: Clearly. I'm gonna put it on right now.
Lois: I know how hard you've been working. And, well, the whole family appreciates it.
Brian: Thank you, Lois.
Lois: I should go. We'll be waiting downstairs whenever you're ready. And Brian-you look very handsome.
Brian: [Inhales deeply] Showtime!

Announcer: Welcome to the Quahog Dog Show. Today's competition will be almost as hot as the weather, which is once again in the triple digits.

Brian: Peter, I'm not, I'm not really comfortable with all this. Do I know you? I don't think I can do this.
Peter: But you can't back out now. How about a pill? Something to relax you before you go on?
Lois: Peter, are you offering Brian drugs?
Peter: Not drugs, Lois. Just a little blue thing celebrities take to help them perform.
Lois: Well, those celebrities are wrong!
Peter: Lois! If Liza is wrong, then I don't want to know what right is.

Stewie: [Grunting] You there, child-woman! I'll give you a shiny new dime if you'll roll me into the nearest lake.
Meg: Let me see if I can find you a juice box, okay?
Stewie: And get the lead out, pudgy!

Announcer: Next, Peter Griffin and his dog, Brain.
Brian: Well, we're off to a good start. [Dramatic instrumental music]
Announcer: A beautiful performance from Brain Griffin!
Meg & Lois: Go, Brian! [Crowd applauding]
Peter: All right, Brian. We got it all sewn up.
Brian: What the hell is this?
Peter: This? This is the part where you beg for a treat.
Brian: Oh, I don't think so.
Peter: Brian, you're embarrassing me.
Lois: God, he can't expect Brian to do that.
Chris: It's easier than it looks, Mom.
Peter: Come on, Brian. We had a deal.
Brian: Yeah, well, the deal's off. Me and the little shred of dignity I have left will be waiting in the car!
Peter: Brian, come! Hey, don't you walk out on me! I now command you to leave. Yep. Keep going. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, flip me off. Good boy. [nervous giggling]

Peter: How could you let me down like that, Brian?
Brian: Oh, I let you down? Why? Because I refused to demean myself by perpetuating the stereotype of the good dog?
Peter: This is the one thing I ever asked you to do for this family. Well, you know, this and not do that thing where you drag your ass across the carpet.
Brian: Oh, oh, one time I did that, one time!
Lois: Peter, Brian, please. Let's just have a nice family car ride like we always do.
Chris: Yeah. Except for the time Dad hit that deer.

Peter: Yeah, it looks like it's just a ding. Uh, you know, there's no reason get the insurance companies involved.
Deer: Well, I should still take down your information, though.
Peter: Really? You could probably just buff that out.
Deer: Yeah, but I would really feel better if I got your information.

Peter: You know, you know, Brian, maybe I had you pegged wrong. Maybe you really don't care about this family.
Brian: Peter, if you cared about me, you'd never ask me to do something so degrading.
Peter: Look, the next time I ask you to do something, I expect you to do it. Understand?
Lois: Who wants to sing show tunes? In olden days...?
Brian: Stop the car.
Peter: Is that what you want? Because I'll stop.
Brian: Pull over now.
Peter: Fine.
Lois: Oh, God. Brian, don't do this.
Stewie: Is the doggie going bye-bye? Oh, I'm so sad. Quick! Back up!

Brian: Oh, great. Is there a problem, Officer?
Cop: Can I see your license, boy?
Brian: Boy? Oh-oh, God. I left it on my other collar.
Cop: You been chasing cars tonight, boy?
Brian: Look, the name is Brian. I was just out for a little walk. That's all.
Cop: Uh-huh, without a leash. I'm gonna have to ask you to lie down on the sidewalk. Down!
Brian: I don't believe this.

Peter: I don't suppose you could let us off with a warning, huh?
Cop: Sorry, sir. But leash laws are for his own good. The fine is $10. You behave, little fella, you hear me?
Brian: [Slave voice] Oh, Lordy, Lordy, I'll never roam again! [normal voice] Jackass.
Peter: Hey, he's the law outside this house, just like I'm the law inside this house. And you better start obeying both of us.
Brian: Oh, look at you. Big man, can't even afford to buy an air conditioner for your family.
Peter: Jeez, what a bitch.

Diane Simmons: Good morning, Quahog! Well, the heat wave has finally broken, Tom.
Tom Tucker: It sure has, Dian. You know what they say, If you don't like the weather in New England, go back where you came from. 
Diane Simmons: Uh, I don't think that's the expression.
Tom Tucker: Yeah, I guess I had one too many Bloody Marys this morning. But anyway...[spitting up] Oh, God. I hope the boss isn't watching.
Diane Simmons: [uncomfortable laughter]

Peter: I don't know how those two manage to be so perky in the morning.
Meg: Mmm. Something smells good.
Lois: Homemade cinnamon buns, fresh from the tube.
Dough Boy: [Giggling] Nothing says I love you like something from...hey, what the hell are you doing, you crazy bitch?
Lois: These oughta cheer Brian up. Cinnamon buns are his favorite.
Peter: Oh, really? I could've sworn his favorite was treat Peter like crap buns.

Lois: Good morning, Brian. My, your summer coat is really coming in nicely. Isn't it, Peter?
Peter: Yeah, yeah. Must be that special jo-jo-ba shampoo I bought you. It cost a little extra. But I would do anything for you, Brian.
Brian: I'll be on the veranda since you're already on the cross.
Lois: Oh, eat with us, Brian. I made cinnamon buns.
Brian: May I have one on a plate, or is Peter planning to balance it on my nose?
Lois: Peter, Brian, stop this. Can't you two go back to the way you used to be?
Brian: It can never go back to the way things were, not after the way I was treated. Not after the things I've seen.
Chris: What did you see? Was it breasts!?
Peter: Aw, jeez, get over it, Brian. I mean, how bad do you really have it here? When I found you, you were nothin' but a stray.
Brian: You swore you would never speak of that.
Peter: Look, you got everything you could possibly want, right here. Now, just eat your cinnamon bun and stop being a bad dog.
Brian: How dare you!
Peter: How dare I? How dare I? Where do you think you're going?
Brian: Out!
Peter: Hey, you're not going anywhere without your leash!
Brian: I don't need your damn leash, and I don't need you! I'm goin' for a walk.
Peter: Don't worry. He won't get far without this.

Peter: Uh, no, thank you. I just had it cleaned. No. Aw, jeez.
Brian: All set, sir.
Peter: I don't have any change. Sorry.
Brian: Oh. Uh, that's okay. No charge. [Sad instrumental music]
Peter: Wait. [Stammering] You hungry? 'Cause, you know, my wife makes this beef-a-roni casserole. Out of this world.

Brian: And a pack of Eldorados, unfiltered. What? Oh, that. Yeah. I'll clean that up on my way out.
Clerk: See that sign? Now why don't you go tie yourself up to that parking meter? I don't want any trouble. 

Daughter: Mom, have you ever had a problem with freshness?
Mother: What do you mean, honey?
Daughter: You know. Have you ever felt not so fresh?
Mother: I'm not sure what you're...I don't follow you.
Daughter: Have you ever felt like you're, you know dirty? Down there?
Mother: [Exclaiming] Oh, God, no!

Lois: Oh, that was Brian's favorite commercial.
Peter: Brian. Brian. Brian. No, it's not ringing a bell.
Lois: Oh, stop it! We all miss him. Go find him, apologize, and bring him home.
Peter: Look-you heard him. He doesn't want to be a part of this family. And we don't need him-we can get another pet.
Chris: No way, Dad. No one can take Brian's place.
Stewie: Silence! Silence! That mongrel is probably decomposing on the side of a dirt road as we speak. Let's get a kitty!
Peter: See, gang? Stewie's got the right idea.
Lois: I don't know, Peter.
Peter: Lois, trust me. We'll get a lovable kitty-cat and everybody will feel a lot better.

Peter: Here, kitty, kitty. Come on down, nice and easy. That's a good kitty. [Gasping] What the hell was that?
Brian: Uh, something near a window. Preferably a booth.

Brian: Aargh! Yeah, you got 50 Puerto Ricans in the kitchen! Yeah, that's authentic Italian.

Brian: Oh, don't do that. That's what they expect you to do.
Tramp: [barks]
Brian: Okay, fine for you. But what about your puppies? And your puppies' puppies? Am I the only one who's outraged here? I'm sorry. Enjoy your dinner.

Peter: Hey, how come you're still setting a place for Brian?
Lois: Because when he comes home, I want him to know he never left our thoughts. I know you're thinking about him, too, Peter.
Peter: Look, Lois, he broke his promise to me. Besides, we have a new pet. And we love our fluffy kitty.

Woman: Oh, gross. Did he just drink from the fountain?
Cop: Hey! Hey, you! Stay! [Dramatic instrumental music]

Brian: Joyce DeWitt? So that's where you've been.
Joyce DeWitt: Shh.

Security Guard: Sorry, pooch. You gotta sleep outside. No dogs allowed in the bus station.
Brian: My blind guy's in the john.
Security Guard: I'll point him in your direction.

Peter: [sigh] Brian's tennis ball. Man, he loved to play with this thing.
Referee: Double fault!
Brian: Augh! Come on, Brian.

Lois: Peter, why don't you just admit you miss Brian?
Peter: You're right, Lois. Who am I kidding? This family needs Brian. I need him.
Peter: [Cat howling] God, I hate this freakin' cat.

Brian: Can you spare some change?
Man: Why? So you can go buy yourself another bottle of booze? Why don't you try and make something of your life, like this dog?
Brian: That's me! I mean, that was me.
Man: Yeah, sure.
Brian: No, I mean it. That was me.
Man: Get away from me, you crazy animal!
Brian: All right. All right. You want me to be a crazy animal? Okay, I'm a crazy animal!
Man: Stop! Help! Help!
Brian: All right, who wants to be next? You? You?
Peter: Hey, Brian. Brian! I'm here to bring you...
Cop: You're going downtown, pal.
Peter: ...home.

Brian: Hi. How's it going? Oh, God. Uh, I know karate! [Kung fu noises] [Dog growling]
Brian: Oh, look! A tasty little baby! Well, I see somebody's been neutered.

Felicia: Come on, sugar. It's time.
Brian: Thank God.
Judge: He's cute. Aren't you precious? Lethal injection. Next!
Brian: What?
Peter: Oh, no! You can't do this!
Stewie: Well, who's up for a little lunch, hmm? Something festive. Did someone say Tex-Mex?
Felicia: I'm sorry, sugar.
Brian: Help me.
Peter: Don't worry, buddy. I'll get you out of this! I'm gonna get us the best help there is. 

Lois: You're looking well.
Brian: Don't get too close. They say I'm dangerous. That's why the man's gonna put me down.
Lois: Don't say that, Brian. Peter is working on your appeal. You'll see. Everything's gonna work out.
Brian: Ha! I may have been born with my eyes closed, but now I see the world for what it is. I'm a second-class citizen, Lois.

Peter: Brian! Great news! The City Council agreed to hear your case!
Brian: You're kidding! If I prepare my case, I might have a chance after all. Oh, I don't know how to thank you, Peter.
Lois: We're family. This is what we do for each other. Right, Peter? Peter, don't stare! [Intense instrumental music]

Felicia: Oh, good luck, sweetness.
Brian: Thanks, Felicia.

Councilman: This meeting was called to review the judgment in City of Quahog against Brian Griffin.
Brian: Justice. For all? Or for some? Does a dog not feel? If you scratch him, does his leg not shake? Yes, he is man's best friend. But what, what manner of friend is man? I would like to cite, if I may, the case of 
Councilman: Wait a minute. Why are we listening to a dog? Take him away!
Brian: But, but does not every dog have his day?
Peter: Wait! Please! Please! I gotta say something! Look, all Brian's ever wanted is the same respect he gives us. Well, you know, that and Snausages. He's mental for those Snausages. And sure, sometimes we have arguments, like when he's sleeping on the bed and Lois is in the oodmay but Brian won't amscray.
Lois: Peter...
Peter: Okay, okay, okay. Look. The point is, he's a member of our family first and a dog second. And I'm real sorry I forgot that, buddy. Sometimes we all need a second chance. Sometimes we all need to forgive!

Chris: I stole $10 from Meg's room!
Meg: I stole $10 from Mom's purse!
Lois: I've been making counterfeit $10 bills for years.

Councilman: Mr. Griffin, this dog is a danger to society. Albeit an articulate and charismatic one. But the law is the law and can't be circumvented by pretty words.
Peter: I'll give you each $20.
councilman: Deal. He can go. [All cheering]

Stewie: Mistrial, damn you! Mistrial! [Triumphant instrumental music]

Cop: No. Let him go.

Lois: Anybody want more pizza rolls?

Lois: Come on, kids. Bedtime. Good night, Brian. And welcome home.
Chris: Good night, you guys.
Meg: Good night.
Stewie: Dog?
Brian: Yeah? [Brian licks Peter's face]
Brian: If you ever tell anyone about that, I will kill you.

Stewie: I say, Mother, this hot dog has been on my plate for a full minute and it hasn't yet cut itself.
Lois: Honey, I'll be right there.
Stewie: Oh, by all means, take your time. Oh, and when you do finally get around to it, I'll be the one covered in flies, with a belly that protrudes halfway to bloody Boston!

Meg: Mom, there is no way I'm sleeping in Chris' room this weekend! It smells like old milk in there!
Chris: Hey, if I could find it, I'd clean it up!
Lois: Kids, keep it down. I haven't even told your father that [whisper] Aunt Marguerite is coming to visit.
Peter: Who said Marguerite?
Lois: Peter, it's just for a week.
Peter: A week! Aw, jeez. No, no, no, no. Please, God, kill me now. No, no, damn, damn, crap, damn it to hell, son of a...
Lois: Peter!
Peter: Lois, sometimes it's appropriate to swear.

Bailiff: Do you swear to tell the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Peter: I do. You bastard.

Lois: I love Aunt Marguerite. Because if it wasn't for her, I never would've met you, Peter.

Lois: Aunt Marguerite, have you seen my towel?
Aunt Marguerite: Have the towel boy bring you another.
Lois: I don't want to bother him.
Aunt Marguerite: Nonsense, dear. You're a Pewterschmidt. Towel boy!

Peter: Hi, my name is towel. I have a Peter for you. My name is Peter, and I'll be your nipples...towel boy! Aw, jeez.

Lois: Okay, everyone. Give Aunt Marguerite a big Griffin family welcome. Aunt Marguerite!
Aunt Marguerite: Lois! [gasp]
Lois: Oh, my God! She's dead!
Peter: Whoa! Careful what you wish for, huh, Lois?

Chris: What if they bury her, and she like, wakes up because she wasn't really dead, she was only sleeping?
Meg: Yeah. That's what happened to our big brother, Jimmy. That's why Mom and Dad adopted you.
Chris: What?

Lois: Peter, you remember Coco, my friend from Newport?
Coco: Peter, I almost didn't recognize you without a towel on your arm. Lois, where are your parents? Don't tell me they're still on safari.
Lois: You know Daddy. He won't rest until he kills something on every continent. But I'm hoping they'll be back in time for Christmas.
Peter: Yeah, it just wouldn't be Christmas without your parents.

Carter: Oh, I dropped my watch. Peter, would you be a sport and fetch it for me?
Peter: Sure thing, Mr. Pewterschmidt. [Screaming]
Carter: Peter, we've got to put that out!
Peter: Ow! Ow! Ow!

Peter: I'm telling you, Brian, nothing changes. These bluebeards still treat me like scum, just 'cause I'm not loaded. Well, I got news for them. I am as elegant as anyone in this room.

Lois: Peter, we have to meet with Aunt Marguerite's lawyer tomorrow. She left us something in her will.
Peter: Holy crap! Ah, you sweet old broad, I love you!
Peter: [humming] Oh, my God. She's dead.

Lawyer: Madam Pewterschmidt's passing has saddened us all.
Peter: Yeah, it's a real tragedy. What did we get? What did we get? Come on, big money, big money, big money! No whammy! No whammy! Stop!
Lois: Peter, please! I'm sorry. He's stricken with grief.
Lawyer: Before she passed, your aunt recorded a message for you.

Robin Leach: Newport, Rhode Island. Home of New England's most elegant and historic estates: the Breakers, Rosecliff, and exquisite Cherrywood Manor, the palatial mansion of Marguerite Pewterschmidt. Marguerite is a shining example of how people with a lot of money are just plain better than everyone else.
Aunt Marguerite: Lois, you were always my favorite niece. I just knew you'd find a wonderful man who would make all your dreams come true. But I was wrong.
Peter: And now you're dead. Score one for Peter.
Lois: Shhh!
Aunt Marguerite: It's time you started living like a Pewterschmidt. That's why I'm giving you my summer home in Newport.
Lois: Cherrywood? That's so generous of Aunt Marguerite.
Peter: Our own summer house! Now I feel kinda bad for doing that thing with her toothbrush.

Servant: That's a wrap, people. Now let's get the hell out of here.
Peter: Wait a second, where you going?
Servant: The old bag only paid us up through the song.
Lois: Well, we can just pick up after ourselves. After all, we'll only be here on weekends.
Peter: No, no, Lois. It's time you started living like the piece of Schmidt you are.
Lois: That's Pewterschmidt.
Peter: Wait, you guys! You guys, you're all hired to be full time Griffin servants.
Lois: Peter, where are we going to get the money to pay all these people?
Peter: Simple. I, uh, sold our house in Quahog.
Lois: You sold our home?!
Peter: Surprise!
Lois: Peter, how could you?
Peter: Whoops. I recognize that tone. Tonight I sleep alone. But still?
Lois: Peter, how could you sell our house in Quahog without even asking me?
Peter: Ah, honey, this is where you belong. You deserve a big house and nice stuff. Like diamonds.
Lois: But I love our old house. You have to buy it back.
Peter: It's too late for that. Our stuff is packed. It's on its way here. Come on, Lois, you'll love living in Newport. Sure, this house is big, but it's also very intimate. [Echoing] Intimate. Intimate.
Meg: So we're really gonna live here now?
Peter: That's right, honey.
Lois: I don't know, Peter.
Meg: Please, Mom. Look, there's a pool.
Chris: Yeah. And there's a chair.

Sebastian: The solarium is at the far end of the west wing.
Twins: Come play with us, Stewie, forever and ever and ever.
Stewie: Yes. All work and no play makes Stewie a dull boy.
Sebastian: Across the hall from the library we have the billiard room. And here we have the lounge.
Brian: Sweet Mary, mother of God! Jackpot!
Bartender: What can I get you, sir? We have 10 varieties of single malt scotch and a wine cellar with over 10,000 bottles.
Brian: Don't make me beg.
Lois: Well, I did love spending time here when I was a kid.
Chris: All right, Mom!

Coco: Jonathan and I just returned from sailing our yacht around the world.
Peter: Oh, oh. Funny sailing story. All right, this guy's on his boat, in the middle of the ocean, right, and he sees a little black dog. And let me tell you, this dog's been swimming for days, and he stinks like a dead otter, right?
Lois: Peter, maybe this isn't the place for.
Peter: Hang on, Lois, hang on. So the guy takes the dog into the vet. And the freakin' vet tells him, get this, It's not a dog. It's a rat. A big, stinkin' Mexican rat. True story.
Meg: Dad, that's just an urban legend.
Peter: Hand to God. I'm telling you, it was a huge freakin' rat. Five times as big as that guy's steak.
Lois: Oh, Peter, that rat gets bigger every time you tell this story.
Peter: Oh, I got a million of them. Like the time my buddy's sister's boss, he was drinking with a hooker in this Vegas bar. Bam! Woke up without his kidney.
Man: [Vomiting]

Peter: I can't believe they kicked me out of the yacht club. I barely had time to stuff Lois' salmon in my jacket.
Brian: Face it, Peter. You have a knack for saying the wrong thing.
Peter: This sucks. Lois' friend Yacht boy and his lovely wife Caca invited us to some hoity-toity auction tomorrow afternoon. I don't want to embarrass her again. You gotta help me, Brian. Teach me how to be a gentleman.
Brian: Well, Peter, it's not really that hard. Let's start with polite conversation. For example, It's a pleasure to see you again. Lovely weather we're having. Now you try.
Peter: It's a pleasure to see you again. After Hogan's Heroes, Bob Crane got his skull crushed in by a friend who videotaped him having rough sex. How's that?
Brian: Wow, perfect. My work is done. But just for the heck of it, let's try again.

Sebastian: More coffee, madam?
Lois: I can get that, Sebastian. To tell you the truth, we're all a little uncomfortable being waited on.
Stewie: Cut my egg!
Servant: Your eggs are cut, sir.
Stewie: Cut my milk!
Servant: I can't, sir. It's liquid.
Stewie: Imbecile! Freeze it, then cut it! If you question me again, I'll put you on diaper detail. And I promise, I won't make it easy for you!

Lois: Oh, Meg, you're gonna love Newport High. It has a beautiful campus.
Meg: Yeah, filled with beautiful people. And I'm gonna bag me a rich one.
Lois: Meg, that's a terrible thing to say. You should marry someone you love. That's what I did.
Meg: Yeah, and he got us kicked out of the yacht club.
Lois: Oh, you can't be mad at your father for being himself. That's the reason I fell in love with him in the first place. Oh, he was so different from everyone else.

Jonathan: Coco, the day I graduate from Harvard I'm gonna carry you off into the sunset on a white horse.
Coco: It better be a stretch horse with leather seats and a chauffeur.
Jonathan: Isn't she a bit of terrific?
Both: [Laughing]

Lois: Kids, if you marry for love, your life will be filled with its own riches. Money doesn't buy happiness.
Stewie: Oh, I beg to differ. [Rings bells] You! Bring me The Wall Street Journal! You two, fight to the death!

Brian: Okay, Peter, I was hoping I wouldn't have to resort to shock therapy, but your progress has been.... Well, who are we kidding? You haven't made any progress. Now, the left TV is tuned to Frasier. The right TV has Ricki Lake. If you so much as glance at the right TV, I'm gonna give you 10,000 volts.
Peter: Got it.
Niles: Well, Frasier, you're so corpulent that when you sit around the magnificently appointed Tuscan villa, you sit around the magnificently appointed Tuscan villa.
Peter: Huh. This is the smartest show on TV.
Guest: Yo, Ricki. That's my girlfriend. She ain't supposed to be having no penis!
Peter: [Electricity surging]

Sebastian: Master Brian, do you really believe you can pass him off as a gentleman at the auction?
Brian: Well, we've got a long road ahead. But, hey, I've worked miracles before.
Presenter: And the Oscar goes to Marisa Tomei!

Lois: Peter was supposed to meet us here an hour ago. I hope he didn't change his mind.
Brian: Maybe he's already here. Maybe he's fitting in so well, we just can't tell him from the other bluebloods.
Lois: Well, I don't think we have to worry about that.

Footman: Lord Peter Lowenbrau Griffin the First.
Peter: Play me down the stairs, boys.
Peter: Good day. Enchanté. Pasta Fazul.
Lois: [gasp]
Peter: Looking good, fellas.
Lois: Brian, do you know anything about this?
Brian: Lois, please. I'm just a dog. A stupid dog. Vodka stinger with a whiskey back. And step on it!

Coco: Peter, you're simply enchanting. You must join us tomorrow for a game of baccarat.
Peter: Right baccarat at you.
Coco & Jonathan: [Laughing]
Lois: Brian, what happened to Peter? He's not cramming hors d'oeuvres in his mouth, or asking anyone to pull his finger. That's not the man I married.
Brian: So, I guess, technically, that-that makes you available.
Lois: What?
Brian: Lighten up, toots. It's a party. [Laughing] Hey, barkeep, it's like the damn Sahara over here! How you doing, honey?

Lord Brandywine: Welcome to the Historical Society auction. Our first item is a 17th-century gilded vessel. We'll start the bidding at $140,000.
Peter: What a marvelous vessel. It would look smashing in Lois's crapper. I mean crapier.
Coco: You are so right. Any woman would love to have that vase adorn her crapier. Jonathan!
Jonathan: Oh. Uh, $140,000.
Peter: $150,000.
Lois: Brian, that sounded like Peter.
Brian: Hey, come here, you! [Laughing]
Jonathan: $160,000.
Peter: $170,000.
Jonathan: $180,000.
Peter: $190,000.
Jonathan: $200,000.
Lord Brandywine: We have a new record for the Historical Society! The vessel goes to...
Peter: $100 million!
Lord Brandywine: To Mr. Peter Griffin for an astonishing $100 million!
Brian: ...Money, money, money! 

Coco: Peter, we had no idea you were such a philanthropist.
Woman: It's a fabulous vase, Peter, darling. Do you collect objets d'art?
Peter: If that's French for Star Wars collectors glasses, then sí.
Rich people: [Laughing]
Lord Brandywine: Mr. Griffin, you're the most generous man since Ted Turner.

Ted Turner: I'd like to announce I'm giving a gift the whole world can appreciate. I've colorized the moon.

Lois: Peter, you don't have $100 million!
Peter: Of course I do, my dear.
Lord Brandywine: Now, would that be cash or check?
Peter: Drop by Cherrywood this evening. I'll have the money wired to me from my Swiss bank account.
Lord Brandywine: Very good, sir.
Lois: You don't have a Swiss bank account!
Peter: Right. [aside to Brandywine] My lawyer's advised me to keep some of my assets a secret, in case things don't work out.
Lois: I'm going home. Where's Brian?

Brian: Listen, I told this blonde inside I got a 500SL. Can you help me out?

Lois: I'm sorry. But I've made my decision. We're moving back to Quahog just as soon as we can get packed.
Meg: Ugh, Quahog, that one horse town?

Horse: Shut up. No, you shut up. No, you shut up. You shut up. You're the one talking. Well, there's no one else here. Look, everybody just shut up! What's that? The wind!

Peter: A pox on Quahog!
Brian: Easy!
Chris: If I ever go back to Quahog, it'll be just so I can poke poor people with a stick!
Peter: Bon Jovi, everyone.
Lois: Now I remember why I left Newport! It changes people. You kids have lost your values. You've lost your mind! And I don't much care for Stewie's new friends.

Man: The Pacific Rim economy is still a tad shaky for my taste.
Stewie: Oh, oh, stop it, stop it! You can't become a bloody fiscal hermit crab every time the Nikkei undergoes a correction! Asia's market has nowhere to go but up!
Man: Interesting.
Stewie: Indeed.

Lois: I wish we'd never come here in the first place.
Peter: [Sighing snobbishly] Here, go buy yourself some more money.

Peter: Hey, old bean. Hey, what are you doing with my Star Wars glass?
Brian: Illustrating a point. Peter, when Han Solo took the Millennium Falcon to Cloud City, he found that Lando Calrissian had turned control of the station over to Darth Vader. Lando had forgotten who he was. It was only after Han was encased in carbonite and taken by Boba Fett to Jabba's palace, that he was able to see the error of his ways. Look inside yourself. You're not a Newport millionaire. I created you. In a way, I am your father.
Peter: That's not true! That's impossible.
Brian: Damn it, Peter! Snap out of it!
Peter: No! I just had the craziest dream where I bought a $100 million vase.
Sebastian: A Mr. Brandywine from the Historical Society is at the front gate. He'll be here in half an hour.
Brian: That wasn't a dream, Peter. He's here for the money.
Peter: Oh, Brian, I'm screwed. If I welsh on that debt, I'm just gonna prove to everyone that I'm not good enough for Lois. If I only had something worth that much money. Man, I never should've dropped Mean Joe Greene's jersey.

Peter: Good game, Mean Joe. You want some of my Coke?
Joe Greene: Hey, kid. Catch.
Peter: Wow. Thanks, Mean Joe.

Peter: Hey, what about this house? I could give him the house and call it even.
Brian: Cherrywood isn't worth $100 million.
Peter: Brian, it's the Historical Society. Look, we just gotta convince him that $100 million worth of history happened here.
Lord Brandywine: So you're saying that Jesus carved his name into this mantle 51 years before he was born.
Peter: Yeah. He's Jesus. He can do anything. And look over here. That's where the stock market crashed.
Lord Brandywine: Mr. Griffin!
Peter: Oh, I'm tellin' you, you can't take a step in this house without uncovering something historical.

Peter: Wait a second. Could that be Harriet Tubman's secret underground railroad? It is! Go, Freedom Train! Go!
Lord Brandywine: I've seen enough. I happen to know that nothing of historical significance ever occurred here. Please, have our money ready by tomorrow. Good day!
Peter: Wait, wait, wait! Look, this is where the Pilgrims landed at Fraggle Rock!

Lois: Excuse me, Lord Griffin. Your family is going back to Quahog. If you get tired of being a snob, look us up.
Peter: Lord Griffin is dead. It's just me, Peter the towel boy.
Lois: Peter, you're back! Oh, let's go home!
Peter: We can't. I sold our home. Our beautiful home with the stolen cable and the little man with the penis for the light switch.
Lois: So, we'll find another place.
Peter: Your Aunt Marguerite is probably laughing at me while she's burning in Hell, may she rest in peace. She was right. Everyone was right. I'm not good enough for you.
Lois: Peter, I don't care what anyone else thinks. All that matters is that I love you.
Peter: I love you, too, Lois.

Peter: [gasp] Lois, our problems are over!

Peter:Our mansion is historical, all right. Cherrywood was America's first presidential whorehouse! See, there's Lincoln, Grant, Robert E. Lee.
Lord Brandywine: Those are fake!
Peter: Oh, they're real. And, FYI, Lincoln had the jungle fever.

Dr. Huxtable: So you see, Chubby Franklin lived across the street, you see. Chubby Franklin would always make a face like this.
Theo: Dad, you're not listening. I have a serious problem. I got a girl pregnant. What do I do?
Dr. Huxtable: And when we saw Chubby Franklin make his face, we would all make this face.
Theo: Oh, God! Oh, my God!

Meg: Hey, Dad, you never did tell us how you got our house back.
Peter: Simple. I just offered the people I sold it to double what they paid.
Lois: What? But how could you afford that?
Peter: I kept one of those Lincoln pictures and held a little auction of my own. Thanks to old Honest Abe we have our house back, and I learned a valuable lesson. It doesn't matter if your family doesn't think I'm good enough for you.
Lois: That's right, because all that's important is that I love you.
Peter: No, because your ancestors were nothing but a bunch of pimps and whores. [Laughing]

Doctor: Mrs. Lipstein, I have bad news. The tumor is malignant. I'm afraid you only have six months to live.
Woman: Oh, my God!
Announcer: Got milk?

Peter: Hey, listen up, everybody. Your Grandpa Griffin is finally retiring.
Meg: Grandpa Griffin?
Chris: Is he that guy who smells like firewood and has those big gray pussywillows in his ears?
Lois: Chris, that's a terrible word. Pussywillows.
Peter: My dad worked at that mill for 60 years. That's almost 80 years. Tomorrow night they're throwing a big dinner, and we're all going to be there to honor him.
Meg: Why? We barely know him.
Chris: Yeah. How come he never visits us?
Lois: Well, kids, your grandfather has never been comfortable with the fact that I'm not Catholic.
Peter: Hey, hey, hey, Dad loves all of us. He's just too busy working to show it. He's been that way ever since I was a kid.

Man: And now the winners of the father-son three-legged race: First place, Bobby Hamill and his dad. Second place, Jimmy Lawson and his dad. Third place, Peter Griffin and a stalk of corn.
Peter: Now that he's retiring, me and him can finally spend some time together. I want us to have one of those father-son moments, like on TV. You know, where we hug and the music goes la-la-la.
Peter: Thanks, boys. Just like that.
Brian: Hey, can you guys do that fluttery thing, like when the Brady kids run down the stairs?

Meg: Mom, I can't eat. I'm too grossed out by Grandpa's ears.
Chris: I know. They're like a big, gray, enchanted forest.
Lois: Kids, your grandfather's ears are not gross. And they are certainly not an enchanted forest.

Man: [blows noisemaker] But seriously, tonight we here at Pawtucket Mill celebrate the career of our oldest and most dedicated employee, Francis Griffin. Francis? [Applause] [Whistling]
Francis: At mass this morning, it occurred to me that I may never see any of your faces again. I just want to say that Jesus loves you. But in my eyes, you're a bunch of sinners and slackers who forced a hard-working old man to retire. So you can take this shiny watch and shove it. [Gasping]
Stewie: I adore this man!
Peter: That was some speech, Dad.
Lois: Yes. It's a shame Grandma wasn't there to hear it.
Francis: Bless her heart. She's on another one of her prayer missions in Las Vegas.
Francis: Aye, she's a rose. It's a pity you couldn't find yourself a nice Irish Catholic girl, Peter.
Lois: Oh ho ho. Francis, this must be embarrassing for you. I'm in the car.
Peter: Dad, now that you're retired, you're coming to stay with us. No more excuses. I'm putting my foot down. [Brakes screeching]
Peter: Brian, buckle up. What do you say, Dad?
Francis: I don't want to be a bother.
Peter: It's no bother, is it, Lois?
Lois: Of course not. It'll be fun.
Francis: You're a good woman, Lois. Perhaps you won't burn in Hell after all. Maybe you'll just go to purgatory with all the unbaptized babies.
Peter: Hey, there you go, Lois. You love kids.

Peter: Look at that. Dad's reading Stewie to sleep, just like he never did for me.
Francis: [reading Bible] So God cast the pagans and sinners into the fiery bowels of Hell, where their flesh burned in agony forever and ever. The end. Ah, children love a good bedtime story from the Bible.
Stewie: Yes, charming. Like when God told Abraham to kill Isaac.

Lois: [yawning] That was a lovely service, Francis.
Meg: Super. And only three more hours till school.
Chris: I didn't even know there was a 5:00 a.m. Mass. I didn't even know there was a 5:00 a.m. What else haven't you told me?
Stewie: You know, I rather like this God fellow. He's very theatrical, you know. A pestilence here and a plague there. Omnipotence! Got to get me some of that.
Peter: Yes. We all enjoy the Bible in this house.
Francis: Really? What's your favorite book of the Bible?
Peter: Uh, that one where Jesus swallows the puzzle piece and the man in the big yellow hat has to take him to the hospital.

Francis: [Knocking] Open this door! Open it, I say! [Toilet flushes]
Chris: Sorry, Grandpa. Uh, you might want to give that a minute or two.
Francis: I know what you're doing in there, and it's a sin! If you ever do it again, you'll burn in Hell!
Chris: But I do it every day. Sometimes twice.
Francis: Mark my words, lad. You may think you're alone in there, but God's watching. Don't do it again!
Chris: God's watching me do number two? Oh, man. I'm a sinner, and God's a pervert.

Francis: Megan! How was school?
Meg: Good. Kevin walked me home.
Francis: Kevin?
Meg: He lives next door.
Francis: He lives next door to a harlot!
Meg: Grandpa, we were just holding hands.
Francis: Well, it'll be easy for him to take your hand when God strikes your sinful heart with leprosy. He can take it right home with him! Lord, it's great to see you kids.

Lois: Francis, we were watching that.
Francis: Well, I'll tell you how it ends. Laura burns the roast, and God kills her for parading her bum around in those pants!

Peter: Yeah, not a bad way to kick off your retirement, huh, Dad? Yeah, the magic of baseball has brought fathers and sons together for millions of years.
Francis: [mutters]
Peter: Stewie's having fun.
Stewie: Why does that man drop his club before he runs around? I would bring it with me.
Peter: Hey, who wants a Fenway frank? Nothing says, Please talk to me, Daddy, like a Fenway frank.

Chris: Is there a bathroom here? I don't think I can wait anymore.
Francis: In a public restroom, lad? For the good of your soul, show some restraint.

Peter: Hey, hot dog guy!
Francis: I'll get him.
Peter: Oh, no, no, Dad, they bring them to you.
Francis: Well, la-di-da. I don't need my food brought to me. I'm not a broken-down old mule! I can still work! I can still take orders!

Peter: Oh, hey! Hey, look! Hey, Dad! Hey, Dad, look! Hey, Dad! Dad! Aw, crap. That was money well-spent.

Lois: He just left without saying anything? Where would he go?
Peter: I don't know. I asked him to buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks.
Brian: I don't care if he ever gets back. I wasn't being cute. I really hope he's dead.

Diane Simmons: Well, Tom, the city of Boston is examining its conscience tonight in preparation for a visit from the Pope.
Tom Tucker: That's right, Diane. And I'll tell you what else will be examined, this cock. Yes, the Rhode Island Cock Society will be sponsoring free check-ups for this year's Cock Awareness Week. I don't know why they went with such a suggestive name. They could've just as easily gone with rooster. Diane?

Peter: I'm telling you. Something must've happened to him. He's probably hurt, or lost, or got by pirates! That renegade pirate ship captained by the ruthless Peg Leg Swantoon!
Lois: Peter, calm down. It's his first night of retirement. He's probably out enjoying himself.
Brian: He's in jail.

Peter: Dad, my God, are you okay?
Francis: Don't be using the Lord's name in vain!
Peter: He's okay! Thank God!
Cop: It seems he broke into the old mill after hours. We found him working at a kick press.
Peter: Dad, you left the ball game with me to go work in a mill?
Francis: Yes! I want to work! I want my job back!
Peter: But, Dad, you're retired.
Francis: I'd rather be dead.
Vaudville Tumbler: Dead? I'll tell you what's dead. Vaudeville. You know what killed it? The talkie pictures. But you can still make it, kid. You just need a gimmick. I, for one, am a tumbler. Here, watch my round-off. Hey, kiddo, be a sport. Take the pills out of my pocket and put one under my tongue.

Peter: I don't get it, Lois. Baseball's always been the secret to male bonding. It even worked for Rosie O'Donnell and his father in A League of Their Own.
Lois: Peter, I hate to say this, but it doesn't seem like your dad is interested in bonding with you. All he cares about is work.
Peter: Wait a second. Work! That's what'll bring us together. We can start our own father-son business.

Francis: What are you doing with all them bathtubs, you heathen dummy?
Peter: Pop, why you gotta be like that? We cut 'em in half, stick a Virgin Mary in them and sell them as shrines.
Francis: That's my boy. At least, that's what your mama always told me. Now give me a hug before I give you a knuckle sammich.

Lois: Or, you could just get your father a job with you at the toy factory.
Peter: That's an even better idea! Lois, you're a genius. Now give me a hug before I give you a knuckle sandwich.
Lois: Peter, I can't hug you. Cut it out. I'm serious.

Peter: And this is the nerve center of the whole factory, my station. I assemble our new action figure, Zeke, the moody drifter.
Francis: You mean to tell me you stand here all day playing with dolls?
Peter: Dad, it's not easy. See, I gotta twist on his head and stick a tiny pack of smokes in his torn denim jacket.
Doll: [Coughing] Any of you kids want to see a dead body?

Peter: Ooh. Wait here, Dad. Hey, Mr. Weed?
Mr. Weed: Peter!
Peter: Listen, I was wondering if you might have a job for my dad.
Mr. Weed: Your father? He must be a man of at least 70.
Peter: Oh, yeah. But he's in great shape. Except his prostate. At 2:00 a.m. last night, I thought a horse was using the bathroom.
Francis: Peter! All finished. What's next?
Peter: Oh, Dad, you did my whole day's work in five minutes. We should sell you to the circus, you freak!
Mr. Weed: I've never seen such productivity. How is this possible?
Peter: I'll tell you how it's possible. Because this man always put his job before everything else. His wife, his health, even his own son. Especially his own son.
Mr. Weed: I need hear no more. Everyone, this is your new shop foreman. Welcome aboard, sir. Lead as you see fit.
Peter: Dad, after all these years, you and me together, side by side, father and son, uh?.
Francis: Peter, this is truly a miracle. I'm so grateful.
Peter: Hold that thought. Hey, boys, you're on. Go ahead, Dad.
Francis: Thank you, Jesus. I have a purpose in life again. Hey! Break up the sewing circle and get back to work!

Stewie: My, my. What a thumping good read! Lions eating Christians, people nailing each other to two-by-fours. I say, you won't find that in Winnie the Pooh.
Chris: Please don't say pooh.
Lois: Peter! Are you all right? Where's your father?
Peter: Still at the factory. He's turning the break room into a chapel.
Lois: A chapel? Where will you all eat lunch?
Peter: Lois, lunch is a sin. Taking a break is a sin. Bestiality is a sin. I'm not sure how that came up exactly, but me and Dad have never been closer. Having him at the factory is the best... [Snoring]

Jesus: This'll be for my fourth birdie. Looks like someone's in the zone.
Man: Oh, tough break there, Jesus.
Jesus: Yup. Or was it? Oop, oop, oop. Boo-yah!

Man: Hey, Peter, your dad stinks. I'm working triple shifts, and I'm still not Employee of the Week. How am I supposed to compete with that?
Peter: Hey, where is he anyway?
Francis: Back to work, all of you! What's going on here?
Peter: Uh, Dad, some of the guys think that, well since you took over, work is no fun.
Francis: Work's not supposed to be fun.
Peter: Well, why not?
Francis: Why not? Why not? That's Satan talking! You're a failure as a worker and as a father!
Peter: Now wait a minute. I may not be perfect, but at least I love my kids enough not to spend every minute of the day working! I'm a damn good father, and that's more than I can say about you!
Francis: [Gasping] Peter, you've never spoken to me like that before. You're fired!
Peter: Well, in that case, I'm suing you for sexual harassment. I'll see you at home.

Francis: What do you think you're doing, lad?
Chris: Nothing!
Francis: Something's wrong with your shower. The water's not cold enough. I like me showers colder than a well digger's kerblocken.
Lois: I think it's time someone sits his kerfluffin down and has a talk with his unemployed son.
Francis: If Peter needs to talk, he'd best go to confession to beg forgiveness for all his failings! Have a glorious day.
Lois: Peter, how can you just sit there and let him talk like that?
Peter: He's right, Lois. I am no good. Even my own dad doesn't love me. Face it. I'm going to Hell.

Peter: Wow. Adolf Hitler, Al Capone, John Wilkes Booth. Hey, what are you doing here?
Superman: I killed a hooker. She made a crack about me being faster than a speeding bullet, so I ripped her in half like a phone book.
Stewie: Yes, the fat man's going to Hell. And from the looks of his midsection, he'll burn like a tire dump for all eternity. Oh! I love God! He's so deliciously evil.
Lois: Stewie, eat your oatmeal. Honey, you're a wonderful husband, a loving father, and, for some reason I'll never understand, a very devoted son.
Peter: That's a nice thought, Lois, but sadly, it means nothing coming from you.

Tom Tucker: Well, the moment has arrived at last. We now go live to Logan International Airport where the Pope's plane has just touched down.

Emcee: Hello, Boston! Are you ready to humble yourself before God?[Crowd cheering]
Emcee: What? Have you all taken a vow of silence? Come on![Crowd cheering]
Emcee: Then put your hands together for the one, the only His Holiness, the Pope!

Peter: Hey, I just got a crazy idea! Augh! Why? Why? Why? Hey, I just got another crazy idea!

Cardinal 1: Huh. Hey, did you ever notice this? On page 375, it says "Jebus."
Cardinal 2: It's supposed to be "Jesus," right?
Peter: Room service!
Manager: We didn't order no room service.
Peter: Actually I just wanted to check the honor bar. 'Cause uh, the last Pope we had here filled his shaving kit with Necco wafers.
Manager: All right, wise guy, who are you?
Peter: I'm just a faithful Catholic man with a family crisis only His Holiness can resolve. I've never asked the church for anything, but I don't know where else to turn.
Cardinal 3: Dust him!
Peter: Augh!
Driver: My heavens, son! Are you okay?
Peter: Yeah. I just got bounced by the Pope's road crew.
Driver: It's good you missed me. I'm set to drive the Popemobile, and any slight bump on the head knocks me unconscious for a few hours. I always wake up feeling fine, but it's just so darn inconvenient to be knocked out that easily. Even by the slightest tap. Like this.

Luke: Taking it off here, Boss.
Sheriff: Take it off there, Luke.
Dragline: Wiping it off, Boss.
Sheriff: Wipe it off, there, Dragline.
Luke: Waving at the Pope here, Boss.
Sheriff: Wave at the Pope there, Luke.

The Pope: Are you sure this is Boston?
Peter: Yeah, it's Boston. See, look, there's Harvard.
The Pope: That's just a barn.
Peter: Ooh, someone went to Yale.

Peter: Lois, put the coffee on.
Lois: Careful. I just cleaned the floor.
Peter: Good thing, huh?.
The Pope: Mmmm, lemony.
Lois: Your Holiness, this is such an honor. Please, go into the living room, and make yourself at home! Peter, what is the Pope doing here?
Peter: Relax, honey. I just hijacked his bubble car so he can convince my dad I'm a good guy.
Lois: You kidnapped the Pope? Peter, this is the most reckless thing you've ever done!
Peter: Come on, Lois. What about the time I was on that airplane?

Peter: [Giggling]
The Pope: Peter, you've raised a fine family.
Peter: Yeah, well, my dad thinks I'm a screw-up. Matter of fact, I was hoping you could change his mind. He'd have to believe you. You're God's go-to guy.
The Pope: Well, your father is entitled to his opinion. But more important is what you think. Look deep in your heart, my son. Do you think you're a screw-up?

Peter: No. I'm not. You know what? I'm a damn good father. And I have great kids.
Meg: That's not what Grandpa says.
Peter: Well, Grandpa is wrong. Meg, it's not a sin for a girl your age to like boys.
Meg: Thanks, Daddy.
Peter: And Chris, what you do in the bathroom is between you and God. And if you're sorry, he'll forgive you.
Chris: Thanks, Dad!
Lois: Good for you, Peter. But isn't there someone else you should speak to?
Peter: Yes, there is. Scarecrow, you've had brains all along. Same goes for your heart, Tin Man. And Kristy McNichol, come back to television. We miss you.
Lois: I meant you should talk to your father.
Peter: You're right. You with me, big guy?
The Pope: Peter, I go where I am needed.
Peter: To the Popemobile!

Workers: [Desperate muttering]
Peter: Remember when we brought in that stripper for Lombardi's birthday and it turned out to be his son? I think this is gonna top it.
Man: Wow, it's the Pope!
Francis: Slothful sinners! You're here to work, not sit around with your.... Holy Mother! It's the Holy Father. I am not worthy.
The Pope: Rise, my son. You are indeed worthy, for you have raised a fine son. His zest for life is an affirmation of God's great love within us all.
Peter: Wow! And that's from the freakin' Pope! So I guess you were wrong about me, huh, Dad?
Francis: I was wrong all right.
Peter: Stand by, boys.
Francis: I was wrong about you! You've gone soft on me, Holy Father! Even a tambourine-shaking Baptist could tell this boy's no good!
The Pope: Are you calling me a liar?
Peter: Whoah, easy, Pontiff.
The Pope: Because I'll excommunicate your sorry...
Peter: Okay, time out.
The Pope: Oh! I have never met such an infuriating man! You must have the patience of a saint.
Peter: Well, he's my dad. And I just want him to love me.
Francis: Peter, how could you say such a thing? I love you with all me heart.
Peter: You do?
Francis: Of course. I just don't like you. I don't like anything about you! [Music stops]
Peter: Keep playing, you guys. I think this is as good as its going to get. Dad, to be honest, I don't like you, either. Aw, jeez, that's a terrible thing to say. I guess I am going to Hell.
The Pope: Peter, the good Lord said to honor thy father. He never said anything about liking him.
Peter: Well, in that case, Dad, I'm gonna eat meat on Fridays, golf on Sundays, laugh at Jewish comedians, and yes, sleep with my Protestant wife. But I won't enjoy it. And she hates it.
Francis: Well, fine. I'll be on me way. Take back your job, and give your old man a hug.
Peter: I love you, Dad.
Francis: I know you do, son.
Peter: What are you gonna do now?
Francis: I don't know. I guess the good Lord doesn't have much use for an old man like me.
The Pope: Well...I suppose I could use another pair of hands on my tour.
Peter: You'd give Dad a job, even knowing what a jerk he is?
The Pope: I have to. As you said, Peter, I am the freakin' Pope. [Crowd cheering on TV]

Francis: All right, get back! No flash photography, or you'll go straight to Hell! You! You're in God's house, you heathen! Take that cap off before I take it off for you!
Lois: Well, I think your father found the perfect job.
Peter: Let's hope so. I love being a good father. But I don't want to have to be a good son again for a long, long time. [Knocking]

Peter's Mom: Peter, open the door, and break out the schnapps! Guess who needs a place to sleep it off for the weekend?
Peter: Mom!?
Brian: Oh, my God, no!
Peter: Quick, everyone! Into the pod! [Exciting instrumental music]

Diane Simmons: And that concludes our special half-hour salute to the past 1,000 years.
Tom Tucker: We leave you this New Year's Eve with a look back at some of those we've lost this millennium. [Sentimental instrumental music]

Meg: Kevin asked me to Quagmire's millennium party! I am so psyched!
Peter: There's nothing like a party at someone else's house. You never have to worry about cleaning.

Peter: [Chanting conga music]

Chicken mascot: well, looks like someone's going to a big party tonight. You should pick up a chicken-strip party pack for all your friends. Here's a coupon.
Peter: Whoa, whoa, look, pal. I don't take coupons from giant chickens. Not after last time.

Peter: Oh, yeah. And that nice chicken outside gave me this coupon.
Clerk: I'm sorry. This has expired.
Peter: You son of a...

Man 1: I'm gonna need these by Friday.
Man 2: Ooh. Is that gonna give us enough time to crosscheck the... [Intense instrumental music]

Peter: [panting] Chicken gave me a bad coupon. [Dramatic instrumental music]

Peter: Some other time, pal.
Chicken Mascot: There won't be any other time. The world is gonna end at midnight tonight! Y2K!
Peter: Y2K? What are you selling? Chicken or sex jelly?
Chicken Mascot: Haven't you heard? At midnight, every computer in the world is gonna fail! Planes will fall out of the sky, and all the world's nuclear weapons will explode, annihilating the entire planet!
Peter: No! Silly rabbit! Trix are for kids. Damn long-ears, trying to take Easter away from Jesus. Sorry. What were you saying?

Cleveland: Hey, Peter, in case you didn't know, a balloon tied to a mailbox is the international symbol for party over here!
Peter: Forget the party. The world's gonna end! Y2K! I heard it from a chicken-man.
All: [Laughing]
Cleveland: Oh, Peter, you are the height of just-too-mucherie.
Peter: Well, laugh all you want. But when you die, you'll have to go to heaven. And you know what? You know what? I bet you run into those two dead bailiff ladies from Night Court. You're not gonna know which one is which. And it's going to be really awkward. So bite me.

Brian: Hey, can you help me with these damn studs?
Lois: Aren't you a little over-dressed?
Brian: Oh, well, actually, I'm just stopping off at Quagmire's. There's a benefit gala at the Boston Pops tonight, and well, I'm trying to nail the flautist.

Lois: Oh, Stewie! You're adorable!
Stewie: Yes, yes. I rather like the sash. But do the Huggies make my ass look big?

Lois: Peter, come on! You've had 1,000 years to get ready for this party. It always takes him so long to get dressed.

Lois: Peter, we're gonna be late for my cousin's wedding. Aren't you dressed yet?
Peter: Oh, crap. Well, one of us is gonna have to change. [sighs] Unzip me.

Lois: Where's your father?
Meg: He's still down in the basement.
Lois: Peter, you've been down there all day. I hope you're already... [screams]
Chris: Oh, my God! The government is here! Run, ET, run!
ET: [Screaming]
Peter: The end of the world is coming. Now, come on, get in your radiation suits.
Lois: Peter, we are not missing a once-in-a-lifetime event because of some wacko doomsday theory.
Peter: Okay. Okay. Hey, guys. You know that one Christmas present you really wanted, but didn't get?
Meg: A phone?
Chris: A pony?
Brian: A humidor?
Stewie: A dead Lois?
Peter: Yeah. Well, it's in the basement. Come on. Let's go see.
Meg: My own phone!
Chris: I'm gonna name him Sparky.
Lois: Peter, if you want to stay here, that's fine. But we're going to the party. Kids!
Peter: Honey, are you pregnant?
Lois: No. [Loud crashing]

Stewie: Oh, dear me, yes, yes. This is how I wanted to enter the new millennium. Locked in a basement with imbeciles dressed like a gay Neil Armstrong.
Brian: Thanks a lot, Peter. Right now, I could be in Boston, pretending I give a rat's ass about Vivaldi.
Meg: Yeah, and I could be getting felt up by Kevin.
Lois: Now, Meg, don't you give it all away up front. Make him work for it. And shame on you, Peter. Scaring the kids with your nuclear-holocaust nonsense.
Peter: You said nuclear. It's nucular, dummy. The s is silent.
Chris: It's almost midnight.

Diane Simmons: We now go live to Asian reporter, Tricia Takanawa. Tricia, what can you tell us?
Tricia Takanawa: Diane, Quahog's fabled alabaster clam is about to descend and usher in a new millennium.
Crowd: 10, 9, 8...
Peter: This is it!
Crowd: 6, 5, 4...
Peter: Hold on tight!
Crowd: 3, 2, 1. Happy New Year![Cheering]["Auld Lang Syne" playing]
Brian: A flautist, Peter!
Lois: Well, I hope you're happy. Come on, kids. We can still make the party if we... [Earth rumbling] [Whooshing] [crashing]

Military Guy: Nice work, Lieutenant. Very festive.
Lieutenant: Actually, sir, each of those lights represents a missile launching by itself. The pattern is just a coincidence.
Military Guy: Oh, well, now that you mention it, the Y is a little misshapen. Still, it's pretty amazing. [Explosion]

Peter: Good morning, family. Hey, Lois, you remember when I was the third Hardy Boy?
Lois: Peter, there was no third Hardy Boy.
Peter: Oh, really? Just like there was no apocalypse? He shoots! He scores! [Crashing]
Lois: Okay, we were wrong about the end of the world, and you were right. Can we please just drop it?
Meg: It's just not fair. I finally get a date with Kevin, and he gets vaporized!
Chris: He's just using that as an excuse. [Laughs]
Lois: Let's just be grateful we survived the apocalypse healthy and mutation-free.

Cleveland: I said I can do it.
Quagmire: Hey, shut up!
Peter: Hey, Clevemire.
Quagmire: That's Quagland.
Cleveland: Quagland? Oh, you must be dreaming.
Quagmire: Not about kicking your fat ass!
Lois: Boys, please. You used to be so close.
Cleveland: Sorry, Lois. We're both a little crabby, on account of the fact that neither one of us has had any food since we got fused together.
Lois: Well, we just finished off what was left in the kitchen. When I think of all the food we've wasted in this house...

Peter: Here, Tom Selleck. Come on. Down the hatch. Come on. Hey! Hey! None for you, Higgins! Trying to steal Tom Selleck's food! No. No! You've had yours!
Lois: Thank goodness Peter bought a supply of dehydrated meals before the blast. Peter, what are you doing? You just ate a year's worth of food!
Peter: What a waste of money. I'm still hungry.[Slushy oozing]
Peter: Everyone leave. I have to poop. Now!

Brian: Well, so much for finding food at the Stop 'N Shop.
Peter: Figures. The one time I remember my Value Club Card.
Brian: Wait a minute. I smell barbecue. [Gasping]
Tom Tucker: So what do you think, Diane? Can I cook, or what?
Diane Simmons: Mmm, delicious, Tom. I guess we should be eating her with chopsticks.
Brian: Oh, my God! They're eating Asian reporter, Trisha Takanawa.
Peter: That's crazy. They're just gonna be hungry again in an hour.

Chris: Come on, Woody. We're gonna search for food.
Peter: Sorry, Chris. The plant can't come.
Lois: It's his best friend.
Peter: Lois, it'll just be another mouth to feed. I'll take care of Woody, son. [Gunshot]
Chris: What was that?
Peter: Nothing. Let's go.
Lois: Go where? If there's no food in Quahog what makes you think there's gonna be food anywhere else?
Peter: Lois, everyone knows there are only two things that can survive a nucular holocaust cockroaches and Twinkies. And there's a Twinkie factory in Natick.
Lois: Twinkies?
Peter: Yeah. I saw a story about them on A&E.

Announcer: And now back to A&E's Biography, Twinkie the Kid.
Greg Twinkee: [stammering] It was difficult for Twink to play with other children. He was different. He was definitely... He had no bones. And he couldn't really play any sports.
Sheila Twinkee: Yeah. That's why, you know, we got him the lasso.
Greg Twinkee: Yeah.
Sheila Twinkee: He'd spend hours in the backyard, playing Wonder Woman. [Laughing] He's gonna kill me.
Greg Twinkee: He loved that lasso. Not as much as the baton. But we put a stop to the baton. He was different enough, you know?

Peter: We just gotta get to that Twinkie factory, and we'll have all the food we need.
Lois: Well, good-bye, sweet home. Maybe someday we'll return.
Peter: Hey, Joe, can you keep an eye on the place?
Joe: I might as well. I'm melted to the ground.
Meg: There you go, Mr. Swanson. These oughta keep the rats away.
Joe: Thanks, hon. Stay in school!
Mutant Rat: [Roaring]
Joe Swanson: Bring it on!

Lois: Look, Peter! People!
Jorad: Halt!
Peter: Uh-oh.
Jorad: I am Jorad. I and my band of highway warriors control this territory. Do you have any food?
Peter: Uh, no. That's why we're on the road.
Jorad: Then you may not pass until you answer the following question. Name something you take on a picnic.
Meg: Blankets.
Brian: Potato salad.
Chris: Chicken.
Stewie: A dead Lois.
Peter: Okay. We're gonna go with potato salad.
Jorad: Show me potato salad!
Peter: [Whispering] Maybe we should go now.

Peter: Aw, jeez! Out of gas?
Chris: Hey, Dad, look!
Old Man: Well, howdy, strangers. You look plumb tuckered. Like to sit a spell?
Lois: Actually, we are tired.
Chris: And hungry.
Old Man: Well, we got plenty of room here and all the fresh apples you can eat.
Lois: Oh, Peter! We found a new home!
Peter: What are you talkin' about? We're going to Natick!
Meg: For what? A Twinkie factory that might not even exist anymore?
Brian: She's right. Besides, this place is paradise.
Old Man: Sure is. Except for Randy Newman.
Peter: Randy Newman?
Old Man: Yup. Just sits there all night and day singing about what he sees.

Brian: Oh, my God! Look!
Peter: It's Natick.
All: [Cheering]
Meg: There's no factory?
Stewie: Ha! Very good, fat man! We follow the Pied Piper of Hamsteak to the gates of oblivion, and look what it's brought us! We're finished! We're done! Game over, man! Game over! Augh! Damn it!
Lois: Stewie, get out of that nuclear waste! Who knows what animals have been in there? [Suspenseful instrumental music]

Stewie: It's about damn time!
Peter: No words should have sent a poet.
Brian: There's enough food to last us forever!
Lois: Peter, we're saved! You were right. We can settle down here and build a house, just like we had in Quahog.
Meg: Yeah! And we can build a mall, so I'll have a place to hang out!
Chris: And two Denny's, so we can always say, Let's not go to that one. Let's go to the good one.
Lois: We can have Quagland get Joe out of the driveway. And we can build a community, just like the one we had.
Peter: No! We'll build a better one. I hereby proclaim this city New Quahog!

Stewie: Well. This isn't very good, now, is it? [Cheerful instrumental music]
Quagmire: [screaming]
Chris: Guess who?
Meg: Stop it, Chris.
Chris: Wrong! Ha ha ha ha! Oh, wait. Did you say Chris?
Lois: Stewie, time for breakfast! Did you wash your tentacles, my big handsome boy?
Stewie: What the devil are you talking about? Handsome. I'm repugnant! I'm a radio-bloody-active freak!

Quagmire: Eh, I fold. Come on, let's go home and get tender with your wife.
Cleveland: I don't know, Quagmire. Lovemaking with Loretta has somehow lost its intimacy.
Quagmire: All right!

Brian: Ah, excuse me, Mr. Mayor. We have an outsider who wishes to join our community.
Peter: Welcome to my fair city! If you want to become a citizen, you have to get a job.
Man: Well, before the disaster, I was a physician.
Cleveland: That's terrific. We need a doctor.
Peter: We sure do. Let's hope you get it. Now pick a job out of the hat. Ah, Village idiot. That's a good one. On Tuesdays, you get to wave your penis at traffic. Congratulations.
Joe: Peter, maybe we should've just let him be a doctor.
Peter: No! These are the rules of New Quahog. Besides, that's how everyone else got their jobs.

Old lady: Go! [Frantic screaming]

Patient: You see, Doc, my back tooth is killing me. [screaming]

Peter: And things have worked out fine so far.
Cleveland: Peter, no offense, but that's because we all pitched in.
Joe: That's right. We built schools, and hospitals.
Brian: Yeah, not to mention the theater.

Brian: We have everything we need. And no crime, no guns, no pollution.
Peter: Brian's right. We've left ourselves defenseless. Guys, we need to make some guns.
Cleveland: Guns? Guns only lead to trouble.
Peter: Right. And when that trouble happens, we'll be ready to blow its freakin' head off! Besides, without guns how would our forefathers have settled their differences?

Lois: Honey, Mommy's making you some new feetie pajamas. And look, it has a little trap door for when you gotta make inky.
Stewie: I'll show you inky!
Lois: Let's see if they fit, mmm?
Stewie: Never! [Mocking laughter] Look at me! I'm Fred Astaire! Ah!
Lois: Gotcha. Oh, you are getting heavy. I'll gonna have your father flood the basement so you can get some more exercise.
Stewie: Yes, yes, I do seem to have gained a bit of girth. Actually, my gullet seems to be rumbling. [Grunting] There we are. Oh, I say. I've laid an egg! Well, that wasn't so bad. I don't know what these women are always complaining about... Augh!

Peter: Attention, New Quahogians. Today my vision for our future comes true. A chicken in every pot, and a cap in every ass!
Lois: Peter, put that away! Where did you get the metal for all those guns?
Peter: Recycling. I used the pipes from our irrigation system.
Woman: Are you crazy? You destroyed all our water pipes?
Man 1: We don't need guns! We need food and water!
Man 2: I have a canker sore on my lip! And I keep poking at it with my tongue! But that's only making it worse!
Peter: There's a reason I'm in charge here, all right? I knew the world was gonna end. I'm the one who found the Twinkie factory and started this town. And I'm the one who gave elocution lessons to Rosie Perez.
Man 1: That's nothing to be proud of!
Peter: [Imitating Rosie Perez] Don't be stupid! She speak good and everything!
Crowd: Let's get him! Throw him out!
Lois: Wait! We can work this out!
Peter: Jeez, I haven't been thrown out of any place since I was a counselor at the bulimia clinic.

Peter: Aw, man, did anybody else throw up after eating that fish last night? [Dramatic instrumental music]

Man 1: That's the last of them!
Man 3: Good riddance! What the hell would we ever need guns for?
Stewie: Victory is ours. [Citizens screaming]
Man 1: Quick! Grab the guns! They're our only hope!
Man 4: Hey, Bob. You remember the other day, you asked me what the definition of irony was, and I said... [screaming] [Explosions]

Peter: Honey, I'm sorry I got us kicked out of New Quahog. I guess nobody really needs guns. I'm not always right, after all.
Lois: Oh, Peter. Hearing you say that almost makes it worth having the world blown up.
Meg: Where are we gonna go?
Peter: I hear there's a Carvel factory in Framingham.
Chris: All right! Fudgie the Whale! And Cookie Puss! And Cookie O'Puss! And Nutty the Chocolate Ghost!
Lois: Come on, everybody. Let's sing a song.

Mr. Rogers: Hello, neighbor. I'm glad we're together again. [Bell rings]
Mr. Rogers: Oh! I think I hear our friend Trolley.
Stewie: Actually, it's your mortal enemy, Stewie.
Mr. Rogers: What the...
Stewie: I wouldn't bother visiting the Neighborhood of Make-believe today, Mr. Rogers. I dare say, you'll find it quite in ruin.
Mr. Rogers: What?
Henrietta Pussycat: Meow, meow, meow, skin graft. Meow, meow, meow, meow.
Mr. Rogers: Oh, my God!
Stewie: That's right, all dead. And now, Mr. Rogers...Fred. May as well drop the bloody formalities, I'm going to kill you anyway.
Mr. Rogers: No, please. Don't!
Stewie: How ironic. Rogers. It almost rhymes with: eliminate.
Mr. Rogers: No!

Stewie: What, what? What the devil?
Lois: It's okay, Stewie. You were just talking in your sleep.
Mr. Rogers: But now it's time for you to meet Mr. Death.
Stewie: Aaugh!

George Jetson: Help! Jane! Stop this crazy thing! Stop! Help!
Jane Jetson: Oh, my God! George!
George Jetson: Did you not hear me out there?
Elroy Jetson: Dad, are you...
George Jetson: Go to your room, Elroy.
Elroy Jetson: But what happened?
George Jetson: Go to your room! For 45 minutes I was out there screaming. I know that because my damn watch is broken.
Jane Jetson: I'm sorry.
George Jetson: Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Jane is sorry! I could've been killed!

Chris: So, uh, what are you wearing? Wow! I bet you could see right through that.
Lois: Chris, who are you talking to?
Chris: Grandma.

Lois: Peter, you've been wearing that giant foam cowboy hat for eight months now. Please, for your family, take it off.
Peter: Hey. Hey, I can take this hat off anytime I want. I just don't want to. Get away!

Lois: Oh, no!
Brian: What is it?
Lois: It looks like Stewie had an accident on the carpet.
Brian: Oh, Lois, again?
Lois: That baby just does not want to keep his diaper on.
Stewie: Here you are! What the hell is this?
Lois: Sweetie, that's tuna salad.
Stewie: Oh, is that what it is? Really? Because I could have sworn it was mayonnaise and cat food! Here's 50 cents. Do me a favor, sweetheart. The next time you're out shopping, why don't you splurge on a tin of solid white albacore?
Lois: Stewie, are you upset because you went wee-wee on the carpet?
Stewie: What did you just say?
Peter: Hey, Lois, I...hey, did you pee in here?
Stewie: In a moment! What did you just say?
Lois: Peter, we have a serious problem we need to discuss.
Peter: Aw, jeez. This isn't another one of those interventions, is it?
Lois: No, it's Stewie. He peed on the carpet.
Peter: Do I-do I hit him?
Lois: No!
Stewie: Bend down, Mother.
Lois: Yes, honey?
Stewie: How dare you sully my good name by spreading your slanderous filth!
Lois: Stewie, no hitting! Use your words.
Brian: Oh, he's probably just ashamed, Lois. You're just a helpless little carpet tinkler, aren't you?
Stewie: Well! The outrages I have suffered today will not be soon forgotten! I will not be forgetting those outrages! No, no! No, they won't be forgotten! Not the...
Brian: Outrages, yeah. I think we got it.
Stewie: Ah!
Lois: Maybe it's time for Stewie to start potty training.
Peter: Isn't he a little young for that? You know what happened to the Lindbergh baby.
Lois: Come on, honey. He's been having accidents. Maybe he's trying to tell us he's ready. This could be a nice way for you and Stewie to bond.
Peter: Bond? James Bond. All right, Lois. I'll do it!

Mrs. Lindbergh: Charles, he's only 6 months old.
Charles Lindbergh: Honey, would you relax? God, I flew across the Atlantic by myself. I'm a national treasure, for God's sake. I think I know how to...ah! Oh, God! Oh, God! All right. He was kidnapped. You call the police. I'll write the ransom note.
Mrs. Lindbergh: What about Amelia? She saw everything!
Charles Lindbergh: You leave her to me.

Brian: Oh, God. Not again, Brian. Why can't you stop peeing on the carpet? Damn it! It's not coming out.
Lois: Brian, is that you?
Brian: Uh, yeah. It's me.
Lois: Is everything okay?
Brian: Yeah, yeah. I couldn't sleep. I'll be up in a minute.
Lois: Okay.
Brian: [disgusted sigh]

Bob Barker: Join us tomorrow for more Price is Right. This is Bob Barker reminding you to help control the pet population. Have your pets spayed or neutered.
Brian: Oh, just die, already.
Meg: Mom, Stewie peed on the rug again!
Brian: No!
Lois: Oh, this has gotta stop.
Meg: God! It smells gross.
Brian: well, Princess, I don't see anyone dabbing yours behind their ears.
Lois: That's odd. It looks like someone already tried to clean it up.
Brian: No, it doesn't.
Chris: Mine smells like soda.

Peter: Yeah, I'm looking for toilet-training books.
Clerk: Oh, yes. We can help you there. Everybody Poops is still the standard, of course. We've also got the less popular Nobody Poops But You.
Peter: Huh. Well, see, we're Catholic, so...
Clerk: Then you want You're a Naughty Child And That's Concentrated Evil Coming Out the Back of You.
Peter: Perfect!

Peter: Hey, Lois! I did it!

Lois: Brian, what are you doing?
Brian: Oh, hi, Lois. I was just washing some things.
Lois: Those look like our sheets and our quilt.
Brian: They are. I'm washing them in some fabric softener, because last night they were so itchy, I couldn't sleep. Which is why I was downstairs when you asked me if everything was okay and I said I couldn't sleep. You know, because it was so itchy.

Peter: Come on, Stewie. Don't you want to pee in a toilet bowl, like a big boy? I remember when I learned to use a potty all by myself. I was so proud.
Stewie: Well, perhaps I could give it the old college try. Why don't you put your hands right there? It'll help me relax.
Peter: Okay, buddy. Augh! Maybe you don't have to pee. Hey, I oughta give you beer. It goes right through you.
Stewie: Wonderful, and while we're at it, we could light up a doobie and watch porn.
Peter: Y-yeah?
Stewie: Listen, you, I'll use these facilities when I'm damn well ready. Until then, you shall continue to sanitize my crevasse and be damn grateful for the opportunity! Starting right...[grunting]. Well not now. But soon!

Peter: Oh, oh, and I want these, and these, and these.
Lois: Only one.
Peter: But that man over there got two!
Lois: Peter, I don't care what the other men are getting. You're only getting one.
Peter: I hate you! Hey, what's that sound?
Stewie: You're urinating! So, it's been you all along! Oh, this is too perfect! I've been taking the blame for Rex.
Meg: Ew, it's everywhere!
Lois: It's okay. Meg, hand me my sweater.
Peter: Jeez, Brian, where do you think you are? Payless?
Stewie: I say, I say, Paco, grab a mop. For God's sake, could somebody get Patches the hell out of here before he decides to bend a fresh biscuit on the conveyor belt?
Lois: It's okay. We'll meet you in the parking lot.
Brian: Oh, God, Lois. I need help.

Intercom: Last day. Capricorn 2537. Our next dedication goes out to Tommy from Kim.
Man: We've got a runner in Sector G.
Brian: What about him? He's gotta be in his 50s.

Brian: Look, I really don't even know why I'm here. The urologist said I was fine.
Dr. Kaplan Well, sometimes these things can be psychological.
Brian: Doubt that! I mean, I've got a very comfortable life. I live with a great family. All my needs are met. Okay, look. So, maybe this isn't where I thought I was gonna be at 7 years old. It's just that I.... God, is it okay if I smoke in here? Thanks. It's just that things don't always work out the way we plan. Do you know I've never been to Europe? Now look at me. Middle-aged, alone, and peeing in supermarkets. Man, didn't see that coming. I had this dream last night. Did you ever see Logan's Run?
Brian: So what do you think?
Dr. Kaplan: I think you're very sensitive, and you put up a tough front. I think you're in pain.
Brian: Damn it, Brian, do not cry.
Dr. Kaplan: I'd like to pet you, Brian. Would that be okay? You're a good dog, Brian. A very good...
Brian: Keep it above the waist, Doc.

Tom Tucker: And now part two of our very own Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa's special report on sex.
Tricia Takanawa: Tom, I'm standing in the bedroom of Judy and Glen Isaacs. Ten years married and still in love. What's their secret? Judy has an inoperable brain tumor the size of my fist. And that just happens to be Glen's fetish.

Lois: Brian, how'd it go?
Brian: Well, Lois, I think I have little bit of me work to do. But I'm feeling things, and that's a start.
Lois: Oh, that's wonderful. You know, like most other people, I used to think therapy was only for crazies and nut jobs. Isn't that silly?
Peter: Hey, Lois, I...hey, Brian. How you doing? They let you out already?
Brian: I was in a therapy session, not a lunatic asylum.
Peter: Hey, hey, hey, calm down. Lots of crazy people have gone on to lead normal, successful lives.
Lois: What did your therapist say?
Brian: Dr. Kaplan thinks the accidents are linked to some kind of mid-life crisis. He suggests I go out into the world and pursue my dreams. I'm leaving tomorrow.

Parachutist: Whoops. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on, hang on. I gave you one of the ones with silverware in it. Take this one instead. That one's probably fine.

Brian: Beautiful.
Man: Augh!
Brian: Oh, my God! Are you Stephen King?
Man: No. I'm Dean Koontz.
Brian: Oh.
Man: [Gurgling]

Brian: But, you know, thanks to these sessions, I think I'm okay. Being out in the world, feeling my power, and no accidents! I've been dry for two weeks now.
Dr. Kaplan: Mazel tov.
Brian: Well, good-bye, Dr. Kaplan. And thank you.

Tom Tucker: Look, I know Stacy isn't your mother but upside-down face or not, you have to respect her.
Brian: Hey, you're Tom Tucker...[yelps]
Jake Tucker: Hey!
Brian: Oh, God. That was rude. I apologize. Wow.

Stewie: [Urinating] I'm a little teapot short and stout Here is my handle, here is my spout When I get all steamed up, hear me shout Lois, it looks as if Puddles has done it again! Goodness, he's wet everything. [laughter]
Brian: I-I swear, I don't even remember doing it. I don't understand this.
Lois: Now, Brian, we know you're not doing this on purpose. But maybe we should consider...crating.
Brian: Oh, God.
Peter: Or you could be an outside dog. Eh? Would you like that? Eh? Outside?

Brian: And how embarrassed was I when the word crate came up? I thought I was past this. I traveled the world, for God's sake. Do you know how much I spent?
Dr. Kaplan: Well, obviously we haven't hit the real issue yet. Drop it. Tell me, Brian, the last accident you remember, did anything unusual happen that might've triggered it?
Brian: No, no. It was a normal day.

Peter: Oh, Catwoman.
Lois: Peter, no Catwoman today. I'm tired.
Peter: What's the matter? Is the mighty Catwoman afraid of a little Catwoman melting spray?
Lois: Peter, no.
Peter: Come on.
Lois: All right. Okay. Enough, Batman. I don't want...
Peter: Not so mighty now, are you, Catwoman?
Lois: Peter!
Peter: Take that. I spit water on you.
Lois: Peter! Batman, I can't breathe! Peter! I'm using my special cat power to get Batman all wet.
Peter: Hey, knock it off.
Lois: [meowing]

Brian: You know, just the usual stuff. Wait a minute. All that running water. That's gotta be it!
Dr. Kaplan: Mmm-hmm. Brian, tell me about Lois.
Brian: Lois. Well, she's a fantastic woman. She's compassionate and charming, attractive. Well, stunning, really. I guess you could say I really...
Dr. Kaplan: Love her?
Brian: No, of course not! Me and Lois? That's sick! I mean, come on. She's my best friend's wife.
Dr. Kaplan: Mmm-hmmm.
Brian: Look, I love Lois, but I'm not in love with her.
Dr. Kaplan: Who are you trying to convince, Brian? Me or you?
Brian: Oh, Brian, Brian, what a mess. Don't get antsy. I got three minutes left.

Peter: So, what the hell, Brian? You cured yet? 'Cause, you know, I don't want to have to live in a house with plastic on the furniture like some Italian family.
Brian: My therapist thinks he's figured out what my problem is.
Peter: Oh, yeah? What does Sigmund Fraud think it is?
Brian: He thinks I'm in love.
Peter: Oh, my God! You can talk!
Brian: [lengthy pause] Never mind.
Peter: Well, does this girl love you back?
Brian: I can't imagine.
Peter: You gotta find out for sure. You don't want to spend your life wondering what could have been.

Waiter: Sir, I need a decision.
Peter: Uh, uh, salad. No, wait! Soup!
Peter: But it was too late. And to this day, I still lay awake at night wondering about the soup that got away.
Brian: Thanks, Peter. I'm gonna go find out how she feels.

Man: I've taken you for granted.
Peter: Oh, get a room!

Lois: Hey, you. The news is on.
Brian: Where is everybody?
Lois: Stewie's taking a nap, and Peter and the kids are out. Come sit with me.
Brian: O-okay. [shuddering]

Diane Simmons: And now part three of Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa's special report on sex.
Tricia Takanawa: Thank you, Diane. Sex. Some people have it anonymously. What kind of person would do that, you might ask? Well, I'm about to find out. I just picked up a complete stranger in a hotel bar and he's in the bathroom right now, possibly doing drugs. Watch as I have sex with this potentially dangerous man as we take you in-depth and undercover.
Quagmire: I've never had a Spanish chick before. O-lé!

Lois: It is so refreshing to see something other than violence on the news. Brian, your tail keeps hitting me.
Brian: If it's bothering you, I can stop.
Lois: No, it's okay. The breeze feels good. It's so warm in here. Ooh, that's better.
Brian: I'd take my sweater off, but I'm afraid it's attached to my skin. [awkward laughter] Smooth.
Lois: Well, I'd better go start dinner.
Stewie: Well, well, well!
Brian: How long have you been there?
Stewie: I came along about the time you started pummeling her with your tail.
Brian: You shut up!
Stewie: You love her! Ha! Oh, this is so good, it just has to be fattening.
Brian: I said, shut up!
Stewie: Oh, by the way, nice rap. I'd take my sweater off, but I'm afraid it's attached to my skin. Ha ha ha! Imbecile!

Meg: Then, Brittany and Amber were like, Let's go to the mall. And I was like, Okay, I'll go to the mall. But then Amber wasn't gonna go, so I went to the mall. And you're not gonna believe it-they both showed up!
Peter: Hold on. Meg, Meg. I'm sorry. That is a really boring story. I haven't been this bored since that stupid drive-in movie.

Brian: Lois, this pasta, better than Italy.
Lois: It's just my Noodle Caboodle. I did use a different brand of potato chips for the crust, though.
Brian: Your culinary prowess is surpassed only by your unfailing grace and the uncommon, sometimes haunting glow of sensuality that surrounds you.
Lois: It's just Noodle Caboodle.
Peter: Hey, what are these hard things?
Lois: M&Ms. I ran out of paprika.
Brian: [blows kiss] Magnificent.
Stewie: Up. Up. Stewie wants to go uppie!
Lois: You want me to pick you up, sweetie?
Stewie: Mmm, Momma's skin's so soft.
Lois: My goodness, you're affectionate tonight. Well, let me give my big boy a kiss.
Stewie: Another! Another! Yes! Momma has candy kisses!
Brian: All right, that's enough! I mean, would you all excuse me, please?
Lois: Stewie...did you unhook Mommy's bra?

Brian: Uh, hi.
Lois: Well, hello, Brian.
Brian: I think we should talk.
Lois: Sure.
Brian: Lois, did your heart ever want to ask something, but your head was too afraid of what the answer might be?
Lois: Oh. Oh, God. Sometimes it's best not to ask those questions. Sometimes we should cherish what we already have. Like a very special friendship, let's say like the one you and I share that someone like me wouldn't change for anything in the world.
Brian: Someone like me wouldn't change it for anything in the world either.
Lois: I'm glad.
Brian: Okay, just to be clear, we were talking about me being in love with you, and you rejecting me, right?
Lois: Yes.
Brian: Just making sure. Say we were both drunk, and we knew we wouldn't remember?
Lois: Well, I'd have to be really, really...no!

Brian: I tell you, Peter, I wish I'd taken this up years ago.
Peter: Yeah, you know, my great-great-great uncle, Angus Griffin, invented the game.
Brian: Yeah, life is good. I'm seven years old, and if I play my cards right I've got another seven years ahead of me.
Peter: Hey, what ever happened to your lady friend?
Brian: We decided to stay good friends. I found out that there are different kinds of love, and ours was perfect the way it was.
Peter: So she dumped you, huh? Ah, the hell with her! She'll probably end up with some idiot. Serves her right. Damn. Damn. Damn. Damn. Mulligan. Damn.

Diane Simmons: Good evening. I'm Diane Simmons. A stunning development tonight, as O.J. Simpson is proven innocent. We have the identity of the real killer. But first...
Tom Tucker: It's fall! The time of year when the leaves turn that pretty, purpley-orange and Quahog prepares for its annual Harvest Festival Parade.
Diane Simmons: Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa joins us live from the ceremony where they're choosing this year's theme.
Tricia Takanawa: Diane, behind me are 1,000 beautiful doves. Gently tied to each of their delicate legs is a parade theme suggested by ordinary citizens of Quahog. And here to pick this year's winning theme is Ten Commandments star, Charlton Heston.
Charlton Heston: Let my pigeons go! [Wings flapping]
Tricia Takanawa: He nailed one! We have our theme!
Cleveland: I submitted togetherness. A simple theme. But powerful, nonetheless.
Joe: Come on, overcoming adversity! Let's go, overcoming adversity!
Quagmire: Show me women I gave the clap to! Oh!
Charlton Heston: And the Harvest Festival Parade theme is: The episode of 'Who's the Boss?' where Tony sees Angela naked in the shower.
Peter: Yes! That's mine! Un-freaking-believable! [Cheering]
Stewie: Oh! Clumsy oaf! Michael Flatley must be turning over in his grave. Wait a minute. He's not dead...yet. Michael Flatley.
Lois: Peter, it's great they picked your theme, but isn't it a little esoteric?
Peter: Esoteric?
Peter: Lois, Who's the Boss? is not a food.
Brian: Swing and a miss.

Man 1: Could it mean sexy?
Man 2: I think it's a science term.
Man 3: Fellas, fella, esoteric means delicious.

Girl 1: I love the color of your Prada bag.
Girl 2: Yeah, but yours has that great clasp.
Girl 1: Hey, Meg, you want to come to lunch? Oh, you know what? There's no room in my car for your big, ugly purse.
Mrs. Canner: Meg, let me tell you about popularity.
Girl 1: Mrs. Canner? Are you coming?
Mrs. Canner: Bye!

Meg: I have no friends, and it's all because of this stupid purse!
Peter: What did you do to my daughter? I swear to God, if you touched her-
Lois: Peter! Honey, what happened?
Meg: Well, it was lunchtime and...
Meg: Daddy, if you really loved me, you'd buy me a Prada bag.
Peter: I can't say no to you, honey. What are they, like, $10?
Meg: More like $1,100.
Peter: [Laughing] You wish I loved you that much!
Meg: [Sighs]

Quagmire: Gemini. Augh! Capricorn. Augh! Well, I know you're not a Virgo! Augh!! Hey, from down here, you look like a Pisces! Augh!!!

Peter: We're never gonna get this float done in time for the parade. Pick up the pace, guys!
Joe: Peter, your theme is a dud.
Cleveland: Yeah. I've never even seen Who's the Boss?
Quagmire: Tuesdays in the '80s I was always in bed by 8:00...and home by 11:00. Oh!
Peter: But I can't do it without you guys, because I'll tell you who's the boss. It's not Tony or Angela. It's not even man-crazy Mona. It's all of us. Quagmire, you're the boss because you never give up, like with the ladies.
Peter: And Cleveland, you're the boss because of your attention to detail. Like when we play pool, you take so long to line up your shots, I just want to crack you with a cue stick. But I don't because that would be a hate crime, and I love you. And Joe, I've had new neighbors before, but none of them were half the man you are. And since you're half a man already, that splits them into some kind of fraction I can't even measure.
Joe: Peter's right. If we work together, we can win this thing. Who's in?
Quagmire: Go, Spooner Street!

Kevin: My dad always says, Measure twice, cut once.
Cleveland, Jr.: My daddy always says, Cleveland, Jr., quit jumping on the bed! [Laughing]
Kevin: We didn't measure! We didn't measure!
Brian: Amazing, Peter, you've inspired the whole neighborhood to work together.
Peter: You know what's really amazing, Brian? I haven't brushed my teeth in three days, and no one has said a thing.

Meg: Hey, Stewie, if I had a job, I could buy the bag myself.
Stewie: Hmmm. I squandered my munitions budget on that insipid Rugrats video! Perhaps I should seek employment. Mother teaches piano; I suppose I could as well.

Stewie: All right, try it again, Richard. And remember, the wrong keys are electrified.
Richard: Augh! I don't want to play the piano!
Stewie: Indeed. Would you rather play the bassoon?
Girl: [Playing bassoon] [Screams]

Flappy: No experience? No, thanks.
Meg: [Sighs]
Waitress: [Whispering]
Flappy: Oh, nuts. Young lady! What's the little guy's name?
Meg: What do you care?
Flappy: Well, I can't send an unwed teenage mother out on the street without a job.
Meg: Stewie. My son's name is Stewie.
Stewie: [spits out cookie]

Diane Simmons: Welcome to the 83rd annual Quahog Harvest Festival Parade. Are you as excited as I am, Tom?
Tom Tucker: Are you kidding, Diane? I've got wood...and clipped onto this piece of wood is a list of this year's float entries.
Diane Simmons: Remember, the float that best captures this year's theme wins Quahog's coveted Golden Clam.
Tom Tucker: And here's our first float.
Diane Simmons: Oh, looks like some wires got crossed on Clover Street. That's not Angela. That's Mona, Angela's mom.
Tom Tucker: Wonderful use of tree bark for the age spots though.
Diane Simmons: Mmm-hmm.
Tom Tucker: This one's got Tony bathing Jonathan. Well, that's just plain wrong.
Diane Simmons: Each float possesses its own unique charm. But none of them-
Tom Tucker: Oh, baby! Look at that!

Joe: Peter, the float turned out great.
Peter: Yeah, our neighborhood hasn't been this united since Quagmire figured out how to get us free cable.
Cleveland: We are not bad people. We just don't want to pay $12 a month for Cinemax.

Diane Simmons: First place goes to Spooner Street.
All: [Cheering] We won! All right! [Uncomfortable laughter]
Loretta: Come on now! This is damn foolish!
Peter: My theme, my trophy!
Quagmire: My aunt Fanny! You said it yourself, Peter! I'm the boss!
Cleveland: Well, he said I, too, was the boss. And it's time Cleveland got his due.
Bonnie: Joe, my feet are starting to swell.
Joe: You two go home. I can stay here as long as it takes. You'd be amazed how little you have to eat when your legs don't work.
Peter: There's only one way to settle this. Russian Roulette. Three bullets, last guy standing keeps the trophy. Me first. No, no, no, wait a minute, this is crazy. You first.
Brian: Whoa, whoa, whoa. There's gotta be a way for you all to enjoy the trophy.
Peter: Wait a minute! I got it! No, lost it. There it is again!
Lois: Perfect, Peter. Now we can all enjoy it. [Muttering approval]
Cleveland: Here's to togetherness!
Peter: Car. Car! Car![Car approaching]

Flappy: Meg, order up!
Waitress: Here you go, hon. From Flappy himself.
Stewie: I don't care if they're from Kubla filthy-wretched Khan!
Waitress: Try them. You'll like them.
Stewie: Yes, well, I rather doubt that. I-oh. Yes! These are delectable. Flappy, good news! I've decided not to kill you!

Woman: What a precious little boy.
Meg: Oh, that's my-uh, son.
Woman: Your son? But you're just a baby yourself. Henry, give the little skank a nice tip.
Meg: $20! Welcome to Flappy's. Why don't you have a seat next to my little baby whose deadbeat dad doesn't pay child support.
Stewie: [Belching] Ha!

Peter: [Horrified scream] [Dramatic instrumental music]
Lois: Peter, what is it?
Cleveland: What's going on out here?
Joe: Clear the way! I'm a cop! Oh, my God! I thought the safety was on. I'm so sorry.
Charlton Heston: That's okay, son. It's your right as an American citizen. [moaning]
Quagmire: What's all the noise, boys? I was just jerk-ed out of a sound sleep.
Cleveland: Perhaps someone could enlighten me as to the whereabouts of our Golden Clam?
Quagmire: Maybe it fell.
Peter: Yeah. Right into someone's pocket.
Bonnie: You think one of us stole it?
Peter: I never said the word stole. Looks like someone has a guilty conscience.
Joe: Guilty conscience! Ha! I'm the only guy on this block who actually pays for his cable.
Bonnie: Oooh.
Cleveland: Pretty high and mighty for a man who left our nation's flag out in the rain last Fourth of July. That's against the law, Officer!
ALL: Oooh.
Quagmire: You're one to talk. Out there every trash day picking through my garbage. That's an invasion of my privacy.
ALL: Oooh.
Loretta: He's sorting your recycling because he loves our Mother Earth. If you weren't so busy trolling for booty all the damned time, you could do it yourself, like the law says you should.
ALL: Oooh.
Peter: Oh, it's on now!
Joe: Wait a second! What about Peter? He's the one who wanted the trophy all along!
Peter: I couldn't have stolen it. Last night I was stealing Joe's ladder so I could steal the trophy tonight.
Lois: Peter!
Peter: What? It's a ladder. He can't use it. It's like taking a watch off a dead guy.
Bonnie: Those Griffins always were oddballs, Joe. Real oddballs. I don't trust them.
Lois: I saw them taking coupons out of our mailbox.
Quagmire: I don't like the look of her!

Rod Serling: I offer you a recipe. Combine one part small-town neighborhood with a dash of missing trophy and what you're left with is a gumbo fit only for a madman. A gumbo served almost exclusively in The Twi-
Peter: Who the hell is that? I bet he took it!
Joe: Where are you going, Serling? Want some of this?
Quagmire: Come back here!

Meg: Well, I'm off to work.
Peter: Okay, honey. One of our neighbors took that trophy, Lois, and I'm gonna find out who.
Meg: I'm taking Stewie with me again.
Lois: Fine, sweetie. This whole thing just makes me sick!
Peter: For crying out loud, we played Pictionary with them!
Lois: Bastards!
Stewie: Giddy-up, you stubby little mare! To the pancake house! Hiya!
Meg: Well, bye.
Lois: And to think they used to be our best friends!
Peter: That was then and this is now! And this is a chair. And that's a lamp. And you have boobies. And I'm gonna find that trophy!

Joe: Well, to be honest, Peter, we were all a little surprised you invited us over.
Peter: Well, we realized our friendship is a lot more important than some stupid trophy. [Kettle whistling]
Peter: Oh, there's the tea. I'll get it, Lois. Two sugars, right, Bonnie? [forced laughter] [Suspenseful instrumental music]
Peter: Damn, it's not here! [Suspenseful instrumental music]
Peter: Not here either. [Suspenseful instrumental music] ['60s lounge music on stereo]
Peter: Huh. Nothing.

Lois: Oh, my God! We were robbed!
Peter: Is anything missing?
Lois: No. I don't think so. Hey, where's that picture of me in my two-piece at the Cape?
Chris: Should I call the cops?
Peter: No, I'm guessing a cop may have had something to do with this. Or a pilot. Or a deli owner. Okay, you dirtbags! This means war!
Lois: Excuse us. We're having a small problem with home security.
Peter: Do you guys have those round metal things that you bury in the ground and, when stepped on, they explode?
Clerk: Land mines?
Lois: Land mines.
Peter: It was land mines.

Peter: Quagmire.
Quagmire: Peter.
Joe: Cleveland.
Cleveland: Joe.
Lois: Bonnie.
Bonnie: Lois.
Quagmire: Cleveland.
Joe: Lois.
Cleveland: Bonnie.
Lois: Quagmire.
Bonnie: Peter.
Loretta: [Clears throat]
Cleveland: Loretta.

Lois: Come on, Peter.
Peter: That ought to slow them down.

Meg: Being a single mother is hard. But the real challenge is having a baby that's addicted to crack. Right, Stewie?
Stewie: What's that? Oh, yes. I love crack. I'm absolutely coo-coo for crack!
Meg: This is the first time he's eaten something other than dog food in three weeks. Well, here's your check. God bless.
Waitress: Here, honey.
Stewie: What's this? Blueberries? Oh, my.... Oh, that's better than sex!
Sandy Balfour: Oh, and could I get that waitress' address? I'd like to help her baby.

Lois: What are they up to?
Peter: Well, Cleveland and Quagmire are holding their positions but I haven't seen Joe all day.

Joe: Freeze!
Kevin: Dad?
Joe: Careful. There's a bear trap two feet to your right.
Kevin: Thanks, Dad.
Joe: Look out for your mother!
Bonnie: There's a sandwich on the counter, honey.

Loretta: Cleveland, these lobster traps aren't going to catch any intruders.
Cleveland: Yes, they will. I baited them with these plump and tasty Fenway franks.
Cleveland. Jr: Daddy, we got one! Daddy, we got one! Ha ha! Fat boy smelled a hot dog. Couldn't help it. Went right in. [Laughing] [Classical instrumental music]

Sandy Balfour: Hello.
Quagmire: Hey, get the hell off my...well, hello, lips, legs, breasts, and ass.
Sandy Balfour: Yes. I was hoping I could ask you about your neighbors, the Griffins.
Quagmire: The Griffins! A bunch of card-carrying Commies if you ask me! All right. No! No, no! It's not all right!
Cleveland: The Griffins are not to be trusted.
Loretta: Mmm-mmm.
Joe: Those people are nothing but vile, cheating, lying scum.
Bonnie: And their carpet and drape scheme...[finger down throat]

Stewie: No! No, I won't! Get that puree of loathsomeness away from me!
Lois: But you love mashed turkey and peas.
Stewie: I'm sorry. What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Did you just tell me what I love? Hmm? Write this down, you toad-faced frump. I love pancakes!
Sandy Balfour: Hi, little fella. Is Meg Griffin here?
Lois: No, she's not.
Sandy Balfour: Probably out scoring more rock. Sandy Balfour, Child Services. We're placing this baby in a foster home.
Lois: What?
Stewie: For God's sake, feed me!
Sandy Balfour: Let me guess. All out of Puppy Chow? What an awful home for a child!
Lois: How dare you! This is a wonderful home![Gunshot]
Peter: Quagmire, you rat bastard! Come near my fence again, and that'll be your head!
Quagmire: Hey, shut up!
Sandy Balfour: Honey, would you like some pancakes?
Stewie: Oh, yes! God, yes! Take me!
Lois: Stewie!

Meg: Next up is Meg Griffin, sporting her stylishly cool, brand-new...
Lois: Oh, Meg, a woman from Child Services came and took Stewie! She said we fed him dog food!
Meg: Dog food, huh?
Lois: Meg, is that a real Prada bag? How in the world did you make $1,100 as a waitress in one week?
Meg: It's easy...when you're the unwed teenage mother of a crack-addicted baby. [laughing nervously]
Peter: Wait a minute. Meg, when did you become a teenager?
Lois: She's 16, Peter.
Peter: You knew about this?

Sarah: Welcome to your new foster home. Baby Stewie, say hello to your new brothers and sisters.
Hispanic baby: Hola, Stewie.
Chinese baby: Ni hao, Stewie.
African baby: [click click] Stewie.
Stewie: Good God! I've been adopted by a Benetton ad!

Mrs. Stevens: I promise, it'll never happen again.
Clerk: I hope not, Mrs. Stevens. Because next time we won't just take him away, we'll kill him. Let's see. Stanley, Starkweather, Stevens!
Chris: So this is where babies come from?
Brian: Yes, Chris. This is where babies come from.
Chris: You told me I came out of your vagina!
Clerk: Next!
Peter: Hi. Yeah, we're the Griffins.
Clerk: Griffin, Griffin...I'm sorry. I can't find your paperwork.
Lois: Well look harder! I want my baby back!
Peter: Lois, Lois, please, let me handle this. The name's Griffin. We're the ones who fed dog food to our crack-addicted baby. Jeez, I never was any good at dealing with the authorities.

Peter: Don't worry, Brian. I know how to handle this.
Cop: Sir, are you aware you were going 50 in.... I'm gonna have to ask you to put your shirt down, sir.
Peter: Ah, crap. I get the one straight cop in Rhode Island.

Stewie: [screams angrily] Damn it! I want pancakes! You people understand every language except English! Yo quiero pancakes! Donnez-moi pancakes! Click-click-bloody-click pancakes!
Sarah: Poor little guy. Pancakes must be street for crack. Damn those parents of his.
Jack: Sarah, forgiveness. Now, Stewie, why don't you go play with the others?
Chinese baby: Stewie, come complete our rainbow!
Stewie: I've got a better idea. Let's go play swallow the stuff under the sink.

Lois: You lied to them!
Peter: You told Child Services that we steal lawn mowers and cheat on our taxes and worship some guy named Stan.
Bonnie: Um, actually, I said Satan. That's a typo.
Quagmire: We didn't know who that woman was! It's not our fault!
Lois: No? Then whose fault is it?
Brian: It's all of yours! You were all working together just fine, but then you won that stupid trophy. You put some shiny hunk of metal before your own friendships.
Lois: Brian's right. We were so obsessed with that trophy, we lost sight of what was really going on. Well, now we have a real problem to deal with.
Peter: That's right! Somebody tipped off the cable company about our free Cinemax. Joe? ...And we have to get Stewie back! I remembered.
Cleveland: Well, we're here to help. And we must get our baby back.
Joe: Right on! Let's do it! Rock their world! Rock their world!
ALL: Yeah! Come on! Let's go! We can do it!

Sarah: See kids? One day the world is going to be just like our home. All races living together in harmony and love. [Creaking]
Stewie: Pancakes!
Sarah: He must still be working the junk out of his system. He needs hugs! [Doorbell ringing]
Stewie: Doorbell! Doorbell!
Cleveland: Hi. We're from the One World, One People Book-of-the-Month Club. Is there something missing in yourlife?
Jack: You know, I just bet there is. Sarah, we have guests! And one of them is a homosexual!

Bonnie: They're in place! God, it gets me hot when Joe lies to strangers. When I get him home, I swear to God I'm gonna grease up...
Lois: That's fine, Bonnie. Go, Chris.
Chris: Here we go, Dad!

Indian baby: Stewie, would you like to learn how to wrap a turban?
Stewie: Why don't you teach it to the Chinese girl? Or perhaps she can learn after her people invade your country.
Indian baby: Yee, would your people really do this?
Stewie: Oh, try and stop them. And try and stop Pablo's people from using drug money to buy arms from Li's countrymen, who will in turn sell them to Ura's people so they can ethnically cleanse the rest of this nauseatingly diverse grab bag of genetic party favors you call a family. So now you all understand, yes? You all hate each other?
All: [Crying]
Stewie: Oh, hosanna! It's the lesser of two evils.
Peter: Oh, hey, kids. I'm Santa Claus. Just practicing for Christmas.
Indian baby: But you're white. Jack and Sarah told me Santa is Indian.
African baby: Don't be stupid! Santa is black!
Indian baby: Santa can't be black. We do not fear him.
Chinese baby: Cram it, Gandhi! Santa is Asian.
Hispanic baby: How can he be Asian? Santa doesn't drive his sled 20 miles under the speed limit with his blinker on! Go back to your rice paddy, Mulan! [Yelling]

Peter: Come on, Stewie. We're out of here.
Stewie: Dance, puppets! Dance!
Peter: Lois, we got him. It's all over.
Lois: Careful, Peter. Joe and Cleveland can't stall them anymore. They're heading your way!
Peter: Oh, crap!
Jack: Hold it right there!
Peter: Or what?
Stewie: Don't shoot! Now shoot!
Lois: So, we're terribly sorry we broke into your home. But we just had to get Stewie back somehow.
Sarah: Well, that's a very long story. But we've grown attached to little Stewie. Plus, the law's on our side.
Peter: Oh, you people can kiss the fattest part of my ass! We'll be back, Stewie.
Sarah: Wait!
Jack: Is that a real Prada bag?

Peter: I'd like to propose a toast: to our neighbors! Sure they may be black, handicapped, and a heartless sex hound, but hey-if they moved out, some smelly Hawaiians might move in.
Joe: Hear, hear!
Cleveland: Hey, where's Quagmire?
Lois: Yes, if it wasn't for him, we never would have found out where Stewie's foster family lived.
Peter: He said he'd distract that social worker.

Sandy Balfour: Glen, honey, I have a question for you. What do you do for a living?
Quagmire: Hey, I have a question for you, too. Why are you still here?

Joe: What the heck happened to that trophy anyway?
Brian: I guess some mysteries are better left unsolved.
All: [Chattering]
Brian: [moaning]
Rod Serling: Submitted for your approval. A family pet with the uncontrollable urge to bury shiny objects in the yard. A shameful secret that nearly buried the peace and civility of an entire neighbor...

Lois: Stewie seems a little feverish after his ordeal. And he keeps asking for pancakes. Let's just let him rest.
Stewie: Oh! Flappy, what have you done to me? It's so hot. Now I'm freezing! Oh, what I wouldn't do for one syrup-soaked bite. [Screams]

Morley Safer: I'm Morley Safer.
Mike Wallace: I'm Mike Wallace.
Ed Bradley: I'm Ed Bradley.
Lesley Stahl: I'm Lesley Stahl. And one of you is hung like an elf.

Lois: [Laughing] I feel so naughty.
Peter: Lois, what are you doing? Neither of us is drunk.
Lois: [Giggling]
Peter: Knock it off!
Lois: Oh, my God! I found a lump! A breast lump!
Peter: [screaming]
Lois: The important thing is to stay calm. It's probably nothing, honey.
Peter: That's easy for you to say. You get to keep both your cans.
Lois: Peter, don't talk like that! You'll see a doctor tomorrow and...
Peter: Oh, no, no, no. I'm not gonna see a doctor, Lois. The healthiest thing we can do is just ignore this and pretend it doesn't exist. Just like we do with the squid.

Peter: Give it to me straight, Doc. How long do I have?
Dr. Hartman: Mr. Griffin, I'd say you have about a month to live. But hey, what the hell do I know? I've been sued by every patient I ever had. Look at the size of this file. This is...wow. Let's just wait for the test results.

Lois: Finish up, honey. Then I'll put you down for a nice nap.
Stewie: No. No! I shall put you down for a nap, Mother! Blast!
Lois: I'm so worried about your father.
Chris: You mean because he's a borderline alcoholic?
Lois: No. Mommy's made peace with that.
Chris: Oh. 'Cause he's got a lump on his boobie.
Lois: Chris, that's a terrible word, boobie.
Meg: Mom, Debbie Miller's dad had a lump on his breast, and he turned out okay.
Lois: Really? Who's Debbie Miller?
Meg: A girl I just made up.
Peter: Oh, look. There they are my family. You know, guys, I don't say this often enough, but, uh, I'm gonna die.
Lois: Oh, my God.
Stewie: High five! Anyone? Anyone?
Chris: You can't die! Who's gonna take me to the Father Son dance?
Peter: Listen, I've had a good life. And you can always be proud of your father and all of his accomplishments.
Meg: What accomplishments?
Peter: Go to your room.
Lois: Peter, there's no way you could die. You're the most important character in this family.

Peter: I'll take this one. But I won't pay a cent over $60.
Salesman: Sir, that casket costs $1,000.
Peter: Okay, $70.
Salesman: What?
Peter: $2,000.
Salesman: That's twice what it costs!
Peter: $40.
Salesman: What?
Brian: He doesn't know how to haggle.

Lois: Peter, what's going on?
Peter: I'm selling all my worldly goods, so you'll have some cash when I'm dead. Yeah, a lot of memories here. Look, my first bike. Boy, I had so much fun playing with that. [child Peter]

Peter: More tea, Mr. Bike?

Lois: Peter, this is ridiculous. You're going to be fine.
Meg: Dad, the doctor called. Your test results are in.

Dr. Hartman: This doesn't look very good. No, this doesn't look very good at all. My nephew drew my portrait. It doesn't look a thing like me. Look at the nose. It's all, all...
Lois: Will you just tell us about Peter's tests?
Dr. Hartman: Okay, okay!. Mr. Griffin, all your tests came back negative. As it turns out, the lump on your chest was just a fatty corpuscle.
Peter: Fatty corpuscle? Wait a minute. How the hell can a dead comedian from the silent movie era be lodged in my left bosom?
Dr. Hartman: Mr. Griffin, I'm saying you're fine.
Peter: I'm fine? What, are you coming on to me now?
Lois: Peter, he's not coming on to you. He's trying to tell you that you're healthy.
Dr. Hartman: Can't it be both?
Lois: [Kissing] My sweetie is okay.
Peter: Better than okay, Lois. From now on, I'm gonna appreciate all the little things in life, like you and the kids. Is this the price of my bill or my phone number?
Clerk: Your phone number.
Peter: Oh. [Sheepish laughter] Well, it's still pretty pricey!
Lois: Peter, who cares how much the bill is? You've just got the most important bill of all, a clean bill of health.
Peter: Jeez, Lois. How long you been waiting to crack out that gem? Aw, this sucks, Brian. Why should I have to pay this? There's nothing wrong with me.
Brian: Yeah, it's a shame you're not dying.
Peter: Wait a second. That's it! They can't make a dead guy pay his bill. All I gotta do is write deceased right here where it says name. And where it says sex, I'll write, No, thanks. I'm dead. It's bulletproof.

Stewie: But you promised the fat one would perish.
Lois: I know. Isn't it wonderful, honey? Your father is alive and well and we can be a family for a good long... [Knocking]
Peter: Who are you?
Death: I'm Calista Flockhart. Who the hell do you think I am? I'm Death. Which one of you is Peter Griffin?
Peter: Uh, he is.
Death: Come on, man. Which one of you is Peter Griffn?
Peter: This is Peter Griffin.
Death: [Laughing] Hey, that's a good one. [Continues laughing]
Lois: Why are you...
Death: No, wait. I'm not finished holding my sides. [Continues laughing]
Lois: Why are...
Death: [Continues laughing]
Lois: Why...
Death: [Continues laughing]
Lois: Why are you here? The doctor said Peter was okay.
Death: Oh, the doctor! Well, I guess he must know, right? I mean, he's a doctor and everything, and I'm just Death!
Stewie: Excuse me. Hello! I'm Stewie. Big fan.
Peter: Look, Death, you made a mistake. I'm not really supposed to be dead.
Death: I made a mistake, huh? Then what do you call this?
Lois: Peter, is that your handwriting?
Peter: [Nervous laughter] How did you get that?
Death: It was emailed to me by your HMO.
Peter: Look, I know my doctor was hitting on me, but you don't have to call him names.
Lois: I don't care what that says! You can't take my husband!
Stewie: Mother! Where are your manners? Don't argue with our guest! Won't you join us for dinner, Death?
Death: Oh, no. I don't want to impose. Hey, is that turkey?
Lois: Yes, Death. We were in the middle of a turkey dinner-to celebrate Peter's good health.
Death: Oh, do you mind?
Stewie: Mind? Of course she wouldn't mind. It would be an honor. No, no, no, no, it would be a privilege. I-oh, dear. Listen to me prattling on like a schoolgirl. Come, come. You, heat up some gravy for our guest! My last helping of white meat was drier than Oscar Wilde.

Meg: Ew. How did you do that?
Death: Oh. Well, let's just say, when I was younger I did some films I'm not...particularly proud of. Well, that does it for me. Let's go, Peter.
Lois: Wait! You can't go. After dinner, we usually go into the living room and live for another 40 or 50 years.
Death: 40 or ...[Laughing] Let's go.
Peter: I guess this is good-bye. Meg, you're the man of the family now. Be strong.
Meg: Oh, Daddy.
Peter: Stewie, I guess I'm not gonna be here to see you become a man.
Stewie: Yes. I think we all know what that's going to be like.

Stewie: A 20-minute call to Larchmont!? Who do we know in Larchmont?
Stewie's Wife: My sister-in-law.
Stewie: Oh, yes, right. Right. Carol. Yes. That's right. How is Carol?

Peter: Brian.
Brian: Oh, God.
Chris: Daddy, can I come with you?
Peter: Ask your mother.
Lois: No, you can't go with him! Oh, Peter.
Peter: Lois.
All: [Crying]
Death: Okay, okay, that's good. Come on now.
Peter: Hey, Death, you got a file on me?
Death: Yeah, somewhere, it's in the car, I think.
Peter: Does it mention that I ran two weeks of Junior Varsity track?
Death: Oh, let's not do this. Hey, look, I caught Flo Jo. You don't think I can catch you? [Screaming] My ankle! Yeah, listen, don't help or anything. I'm totally fine. Damn Irish.

Death: Yeah. That felt good, dropping me hard on the couch like that.
Lois: Here's a couple of Tylenol.
Death: Oh, great, Tylenol. Yeah, I asked for Advil. But, you know, Tylenol, whatever. That's good.
Meg: I got a B-plus in Health. Is there anything I can do?
Death: Yeah! Why don't you boil some water and rip up some sheets there, Einstein. It's a sprained ankle. I just have to stay off it for a few days.
Peter: W-w-wait. You can't stay here.
Death: Why not?
Peter: You're trying to kill me! Besides, how are we supposed to explain you to Mr. Roper?
Lois: Oh, it's okay, Death. You just worry about feeling better.
Peter: Lois, what the hell are you doing?
Lois: Peter, don't you see? As long as he's here, you can't die.
Peter: Go on.
Lois: That's it.
Peter: Wait a minute. So no matter what I do, I won't die? Hey, uh, make yourself at home, Death. I'm going out for a while.
Death: Hey, way, wait. You can't tell anyone I'm here. For if humanity discovers I'm no longer lurking in the shadows, consequences will be dire.
Peter: Go on.
Death: That's it. What the hell do you see in him?
Lois: Peter, where are you going?
Peter: Lois, 10 minutes ago, I was staring Death in the face. But now that I've been given another chance I'm gonna do the one thing I've always dreamed of doing.

Peter: I'm gonna jump off this building.
Cleveland: Could you repeat that, please, Peter? I believe I had something crazy in my ear.
Quagmire: Hold the phone. You took me away from a Swedish girlie-girl and her paralyzed, but trusting, cousin for this?
Peter: $1,000 says I live.
Quagmire: 1,000 clams, huh?
Cleveland: What the hell?
Quagmire: Okay.
Peter: Look at that. I beat my loogie.
Quagmire & Cleveland: [Grumbling]

Lois: It's your turn, Death.
Death: You know, I know I should find this ironic, but really, I'm just bored as hell. Hey, how old is this TV? You can probably get the DuMont Network on this thing.
Lois: You know, Peter is a good man and a wonderful father.
Death: Here it comes.
Lois: Could you please find it in your heart to spare him? After all, it isn't really his time.
Death: What did you make this cocoa out of, crap?
Lois: If you want me to make it again, I...
Death: Sorry, Lois, it's my fault. I just assumed you were gonna make it with milk, not crap!
Lois: I'll be right back.
Meg: I brought you something to read.
Death: Glamour, great. I can learn how to please my man. Go get me an Entertainment Weekly. I hear it's got a great picture of me sneaking up on Tom Snyder.

Lois: [Screaming] [Saw buzzing]
Stewie: Victory is mine!
Lois: Wow. I should really watch where I'm going.
Stewie: What the deuce? Of course! It seems with Death incapacitated, my matricidal efforts are futile. I must do all I can to accelerate his convalescence. Knick-knack paddywhack, give a dog a bone

Cleveland: I can't believe you drank 300 bottles of beer without succumbing to alcohol poisoning. Peter, are you a witch?
Peter: Yeah. But don't tell anyone. The consequences could be dire! Hey, you guys, I bet I can go up to each one of those scary-looking bikers and say: Hey, aren't you Richard Simmons?
Quagmire: Peter, no!
Cleveland: Peter, now you're just being brainless.

Peter: Hey, aren't you Richard Simmons?
Biker 1: Hey!
Peter: Aren't you Richard Simmons' best friend, Richard Simmons?
Biker 2: Shut up!
Peter: [Laughing] [gunfire]
Cleveland: Hey. [Everyone laughing]

Death: Ah, that feels good. You know, actually, kid, I kind of fell into this gig. You know, I really wanted to be a wood nymph. But, man, the second Dad found out, he started in with the whole: I have no son. I have no son, and Mom...Mom just stood there.
Stewie: Yes. Mothers can be quite the botheration, can't they? That's why we've got to get you well.
Death: What was that?
Stewie: Nothing!
Lois: Stewie, leave Death alone.
Death: He's okay. You know, he reminds me a lot of me at that age. I hope his teen years go better than mine. Boy, talk about awkward.

Girl: Oh. Oh, yes.
Death: Oh, Sandy! Sandy! Sandy? Oh, not again. I'm gonna be a virgin forever. Or am I?
Lois: Can we please talk about Peter? He has so much to live for, Death. He loves his children and me...
Death: Okay, okay. I'll spare his life. But you owe me, if you get my drift. What the hell are you doing? I was talking about another fruit cup. Not bad, though.

Lois: Peter, Death just agreed to let you live.
Peter: Oh, man. This really is my night. I get to live, and I'm on TV.

Tom Tucker: Our top story tonight, the rules of Death no longer apply.
Diane Simmons: That's right, Tom. Our own Asian reporter, Tricia Takanawa, filed this report, all by herself!
Tricia Takanawa: I'm here with Peter Griffin, the man who claims he withstood a barrage of bullets and did not die. Peter, are you saying that if I shoot you in the head with this Channel 5 pistol, you'll be completely unharmed?
Peter: Why don't you give it a shot?
Tricia Takanawa: Okay, here goes.
Peter: [Screaming]
Tricia Takanawa: What have I done?
Peter: [Laughing]
Tricia Takanawa: Oh, you're awful.
Diane Simmons: Fascinating story, Tom.
Tom Tucker: It sure is, Diane. And since the laws of Death no longer apply, I can do this.
Diane Simmons: That's right, Tom.
Tom Tucker: Ha-ha! And now it's time for sports.

Death: Great. The whole world is laughing at me. This is high school all over again. Well, I'll show them! I'll show all of them! Oh, my God, that hurts!
Lois: Oh, no. You're not killing anyone tonight, mister! Not on that ankle.
Death: This is all your fault. And there's only one solution. You have to go out there and do my job. You have to be Death! [Dramatic instrumental music]

Peter: Boy, this doesn't leave much to the imagination, does it?
Lois: Death, there is no way Peter can do your job. He could never kill anyone.
Peter: Yeah! I mean, you know, I've thought about it, like in church and stuff, but I don't think I could ever do what you do.
Death: Why, you think you're better than me? I'm tired of always being the bad guy. What I do has to be done.
Brian: He's right, Peter. You've disturbed the natural order of things. People need to be able to die.

Kate Winslet: No!
Leonardo DiCaprio: You know, actually, I think I'm gonna be okay.
Kate Winslet: Oh, Jack. Now we can get married and everything you promised.
Leonardo DiCaprio: Yeah, about that. Uh, I was pretty sure I was gonna die...'cause actually, there's this girl in New York, and it's getting kind of serious. But, you know,thanks for letting me draw you naked. I still can't believe you let me do that!

Peter: So what, you're saying the only way to make the world right is for me to kill someone?
Stewie: I know! Why don't you kill Lois?
Death: No. One death isn't gonna do it. You have to do something that will get everyone's attention, something huge.
Chris: How about if you blow up the Earth?
Death: Too huge. But you're thinking. I like that.
Meg: You could kill all the girls who are prettier than me.
Death: Well, that would just leave England. Wait. Wait, I have it. I'm a genius. You'll kill the kids from Dawson's Creek!
Peter: I knew it! I knew it! As soon as that show came on the air, I said: I'm gonna be the one who has to kill these kids.
Lois: It's true. He did say it.
Death: A bunch of hot, young celebrities. It's perfect! The kids are on their way to LA to renegotiate their contracts. But...but their plane is gonna be making a little stopover in Rhode Island. If you go right now, you can catch the flight.
Peter: Forget it, Death. I'm not going to do your dirty work. There's no way I'm getting on that plane. Absolutely no way, and that's final. See? I'm still here. And there's nothing you can say that'll change my mind.
Death: Either you kill them, or I kill you.

Peter: Aw, crap! Nice plant. Note to self, do not go to the bathroom.
Man: Look, James, your last movie killed at the box office. Your Q-rating's through the roof. It's time we ditched the WB and concentrate on features.
James Van Der Beek: Sir, I don't know who you are, but just because you're sitting across from me doesn't mean you can give me career advice.
Man: Oh. Will you sign my ass?
James Van Der Beek: You have a pen?

Peter: Hello, Death? Guess where I'm calling from? A plane!
Death: That's great. Listen, those kids on board?
Peter: Yeah. About that, I don't think I can go through with it.
Death: Peter, listen, without death, the world would be a terrible place. Imagine a world where Hitler was still alive. Look, Peter, all you gotta do is sit there. The plane is gonna crash in LA. Pilot error. Big mess. Everybody dies.
Peter: Jeez, everybody?
Death: Except you. Hold on, I'm getting another call. Brenda?
Peter: Still me.
Death: Brenda?
Peter: Yes? Just kidding, it's still me.

Pilot: We now begin our final approach into Los Angeles International. If you look out the window to you're right, you'll see the San Fernando Valley where my brother Gary makes a very nice living directing porn. We'll be on the ground in 10 minutes.
Peter: Aw, jeez.
Girl Scouts: We like being alive, we like being alive We like being, oh, we like being, oh, we like being alive
Peter: I guess it's their time.

Death: Peter? Hello, Peter? Peter, are you there? I can hear you breathing!
Peter: Yeah, I'm here. And you can forget it. I've changed my mind. I don't care if you do kill me, I'm not gonna kill those kids. If they die, I'll have nothing to watch on Wednesdays...other than the fine programs on Fox. Hey, open up in there!
Pilot: Hey, what are you doing? You're not a pilot. I know every pilot in the world!
Peter: I'm here to keep you from making an error. A pilot error. Jeez, I probably should've worn mittens!

James Van Der Beek: Nice going, fat...
Peter: Hey, I was just trying to save your lives. But now you're all gonna die. No one can land this plane.
Karen Black: I can.
Peter: Thank God! It's Karen Black! She landed a busted plane in? It was a movie, in the '70s. Ah, you damn kids with your music.

Tom Tucker: Both of the pilots were killed. Fortunately for the other passengers, actress Karen Black, star of such films as Nashville and Five Easy Pieces, was on board.
Diane Simmons: Our hats are off to Miss Black for proving once again, that, given the opportunity, actresses over 50 can land large aircraft.
Tom Tucker: Karen Black. What an obscure reference.

Death: Hey, what the hell? I told you to waste those kids from Dawson's Creek.
Lois: You're missing the important thing here. You said you wanted everyone to know the rules of death apply. And now the whole world does.
Death: Yeah, I guess so. You know, my ankle's starting to feel better. I should probably get out of your hair.
Stewie: Oh, but you just got here! Oh, we can stay in touch, can't we? Oh, oh, oh, what's your e-mail? Mine is LoisMustDie, all one word, @yahoo.com.
Peter: Wait a second. Death? I used to fear you, but now I'm glad we met. Because you've given me a great gift-the complete Boz Scaggs. How did you know?
Death: I just had a feeling.
Lois: We're gonna miss you, Death.
Death: Hey, don't worry. I'll be back...really, really soon. [Laughing] Is he joking? Okay, see you later.


Tom Tucker: It was a moving scene today at Hatch Pond as six members of the Pawtucket fire department struggled valiantly to save the life of a fish, trapped under the frozen ice. Rescue workers managed to get the fish out of the water, but unfortunately it died shortly after. Diane?
Diane Simmons: Well, Tom, another life was tragically cut short today. Robert Kimble, founder of a local theater group known as the Quahog Players, passed away this afternoon.
Lois: Oh, my God! [Phone ringing]
Diane Simmons: Kimble was a hands-on director who often appeared in his own shows, most recently, Miss Saigon.
Lois: Yes, I just heard. It's so sad. Really? They want me to be the new artistic director of the Quahog Players!
Chris: All right, Mom!
Meg: Are you gonna do it?
Lois: I don't know. It's such a big responsibility. I need a moment to think. [pause] Okay, I'll do it.
Tom Tucker: This just in: Lois Griffin is named the new artistic director of the Quahog Players.
Lois: All those years of paying my dues as musical director under that old hack have finally paid off.
Brian: Oh, Lois, congratulations! Our little theater group finally has a committed visionary at its helm. And such an attractive one.
Lois: Brian, you'll have to audition just like everyone else.
Brian: Oh, God, of course. I... you didn't think... you thought I was... Lois!
Chris: I can paint scenery.
Meg: Can I be in the show, Mom?
Stewie: Yes, you can be the dumpy teenager who stays backstage and cries because nobody finds her attractive. [vicious laughing]
Peter: Hey, you guys.
Lois: Peter, guess what? I am gonna...
Peter: Me first! Mr. Weed said whoever comes up with the best idea for the big Christmas toy this year gets a huge bonus.
Chris: Hey, Dad, why don't you invent the Frisbee? That's an awesome toy.
Meg: It's already been invented.
Chris: Then how come I never heard of it?
Peter: This is my chance to prove how valuable I am to the company! Sorry, Lois. What's your news?
Lois: Well...

Peter: Mr. Weed, distinguished members of the board, may I present this year's hottest toy... Mr. Zucchini Head. He's got stupid cool hip-hop style with his little hat and his Doc Martens.
Mr. Weed: Thank you, Peter, that's enough.
Peter: Wait, wait, wait. This is the best part! He dances!
Man 1: I've seen enough.
Man 2: Inappropriate.
Man 3: I haven't had sex in four years.
Mr. Weed: Gentlemen, I apologize for wasting your time. Peter is an adequate assembly-line worker but you'll be happy to know our company does not pay him to think. [Laughing]
Peter: [Nervous laughter]
Mr. Weed: I'll take this. No calls.

Lois: Come on, kids! The director can't be late for the auditions.
Peter: You should've heard them laughing at me, Lois. I got great ideas, but they look at me, and all they see is a loser. Except that guy with the lazy eye. He sees a loser and the snack machine.
Lois: Peter, a lot of creative people had mindless jobs. Michelangelo worked in a marble quarry. Herman Melville was a customs agent. Albert Einstein worked for the patent office.
Brian: I think what Lois is tying to say is you have to find a way to express yourself creatively. For example, Chris has his drawing, Meg does her birdcalls, I sing beautifully.
Lois: So I've heard.
Brian: And Lois has her theater group.
Lois: Yes. And for my first production, I've chosen The King and I. It's a wonderful story about a loving, patient woman who introduces culture and civility to a barbaric, patriarchal. Peter, please don't wipe your nose on the couch. Look, I have to go. Part of being creative is figuring out what you're good at. I know you can do it if you put your mind to it.
Peter: You're right, Lois. Man was meant to create. That's why God invented Shrinky Dinks.
 
Joe: Bravo!
Lois: Brian, that was beautiful! Thank you!
Brian: No, no, no, thank you. And that note you gave me, louder, I was thinking that, and then you said it-
Lois: Okay.
Brian: You're so intuitive. It's a pleasure...
Lois: Okay. All right. Next! Stewie, do you want to try out for Mommy's play?
Stewie: Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of York. And all...
Lois: Why don't you sing Itsy Bitsy Spider?
Stewie: How dare you reduce my finely hewn thespian stylings to mere Mother Gooseries!
Lois: Oh, sing Baa Baa Black Sheep!
Stewie: You know, Mother, as first lady of the American stage, Helen Hayes, once said, I'm going to kill you!
Peter: Hey, can somebody give me a hand with all this talent?
Lois: Peter, what are you doing here?
Peter: Well, Lois, I tried finding my creativity, like you said. First I took an art class. I was starting to think there was nothing I'd be good at. But then I realized that this is it. Lois, my penis belongs on stage.
Lois: Wait, Peter, everyone has to audition. You know, sing, dance.
Peter: [Laughs] I get it. Hello, everybody. This is just a formality, since I happen to be doing the director. [Laughs] Five, six, seven, eight.
 
Lois: Before I post the cast list, my choreographer and I want to thank everyone for auditioning.
Joe: You were all great.
Lois: Weren't they? I only wish the show was called "The King and Us" so I could cast you all.
Brian: [kiss-up laughing]
Loretta: Anna! Oh, baby, baby! I'm a star!
Cleveland: Wow. I've never hugged a celebrity before. Except for Pearl Bailey at a book signing once, but then we later found out it wasn't actually her.
Stewie: Siamese baby? Stewie Griffin does not play bit parts!
Lois: Oh, you wanted a bigger part, didn't you, sweetie?
Stewie: Oh, to hell with you! Perhaps I'll skip the stage and go directly to films!
Quagmire: Aw, man! Chorus! Shoot, what a day!
Brian: The King of Siam? Why, why, that's the lead! This is so unexpected!
Quagmire: Hey, shut up!
Brian: The King of Siam? Why, why, that's the lead!
Peter: Lois, I think you made a mistake. I'm not The King. I'm not I, I'm not anybody. So, what? I had sex with you for nothing?
Lois: No, Peter, I.... It's just that directing this show is a big opportunity for me and I don't want anything to ruin it.
Peter: Ruin it?
Lois: Yes. By not using you to your full potential. You have too much talent for the stage. You should... [stuttering]... you should be a producer.
Peter: A producer? Gee, I don't know. I love Mexicans. I'll do it!
 
Joe: Hang on, hang on, hang on! You overextended the reach! You screwed it all up. Let me show you again. Okay, boys! Let's do it! And one, two, three. And one, two, three. And just like this. And watch my feet. And one, two, three.
Lois: Peter, Chris says you told him to build a set for the North Pole.
Peter: Yeah, that's where Anna goes to talk with her best friend, a penguin.
Lois: There is no talking penguin in The King and I.
Peter: There is in, Peter Griffin presents The King and I.
Lois: What?
Peter: Now we just gotta think of some wicked funny stuff for him to say.
Lois: Peter, the director decides whether or not to add a character. You're the producer, remember?
Peter: What am I supposed to do with all my great ideas? Put 'em in a tub and clean myself with them? 'Cause that's what soap is for, Lois.
Lois: Good producers put their ideas to work outside the theater. It's your job to make sure we sell every seat in this house.
Peter: And that's creative?
Lois: Is it? Well, it's just the most creative job there is.
Peter: Don't you worry, Lois. I'll get the word out. I'll tell two friends, and they'll tell two friends and that's, like, 10 people right there.
 
Tom Tucker: [to self in mirror] Hey, I recognize you from the television. You're Tom Tucker. I bet you can do this.
Peter: Excuse me?
Tom Tucker: You. Get out of here! Get out of here! Go on, get out of here!
 
Peter: Oh, wow! Diane Simmons!
Diane Simmons: You don't look anything like the ad. You better be huge.
Peter: No, I'm Peter Griffin, producer. I'm presenting Peter Griffin presents The King and I a Peter Griffin production, and I'm giving you the exclusive story.
Diane Simmons: Look, pal, some two-bit community theater production isn't news. Who's the star? For that matter, who the hell are you, and why should I give a damn?
Peter: Wow, I'm being interviewed by Diane Simmons!
 
Peter: Well, Lois, you told me to produce, and I did. I got us a story on the 11:00 news.
Brian: Really?
Lois: Oh, Peter!

Diane Simmons: Our top story tonight. I will be playing the role of Anna in the Quahog Players production of The King and I. Tom?
Tom Tucker: Thanks, Diane. In other news, I won't be going to the play because I'm sure it will be lousy.
Diane Simmons: Tom, I'm getting late word that you're a petty, jealous, closet case.
Tom Tucker: Bit of breaking news. We now go live to Diane being a bitch. Diane?
 
Lois: But Loretta's playing Anna, and she's doing a great job.
Peter: Loretta's a nobody. Diane Simmons is a star. Look, Lois, you wanted me to sell tickets, right? Well, people who've never even been in a theater will come see a show with Diane Simmons.
Lois: I don't know, Peter, she's a news reporter.
Peter: Hey, hey, some of our greatest actors started in news, like Sean Penn.
 
Peter: Hey, everybody, here's our star!
Diane Simmons: Oh, this is so awkward. You all know my name, and I've never heard of any of you.
Loretta: You ever acted before, honey?
Diane Simmons: Well, I did an independent film in college.
Lois: Let's start with the scene where Lady Thiang begs Anna to comfort the king.
Diane Simmons: Oh, are you playing Lady Thiang?
Loretta: Mmm hmm. I was supposed to be Anna.
Diane Simmons: Oh. Well, they did an all you people version of Hello, Dolly that was very successful.
Lois: Okay, let's go from the top of Scene 7. Action!
Loretta: Oh, Mrs. Anna, the king needs you. You must go to him.
Diane Simmons: Lady Thiang, if he needs me, truly needs me, I will go to him.
Peter: Cut! All wrong! No good!
Lois: Peter, what are you doing? She was wonderful.
Loretta: My ass.
Lois: Besides, I'm the director.
Peter: It just doesn't feel real, you know? Anna and Miss Thing both love the king, right? On Springer yesterday, they had I won't share my husband and these two women bitch-slapped each other. The crowd went nuts. Loretta, why don't you try slapping Diane?
Loretta: I think I can do that.
Lois: Wait a minute. Nobody's slapping anybody. This is Rodgers and Hammerstein, not trash TV!
Diane Simmons: I think Peter may be onto something. Springer is one of our station's highest-rated shows.
Lois: I don't know.
Peter: I thought you wanted to do a good show? If you want to do a bad show, why don't we just do Rent?
Lois: I guess we can try that...
Loretta: Action!

Peter: Come on, Lois. Those hoop skirts make Diane look a little hippy, you know? I was thinking we could dress her in a pair of sequined capri pants.
Lois: Peter, they didn't have capri pants in the 1860s.
Peter: They did now! Ah!
Stewie: You! You are the worst thing to happen to musical theater since Andrew Lloyd Webber! And you! Well, I just plain don't like you.
 
ALL: [Laughing]
Lois: What's going on?
Peter: We're just having a little pow wow to discuss my latest changes.
Lois: What changes?
Peter: The Siamese children. How about this? They're not children. They're aliens!
Quagmire: That was great, Peter.
Brian: Right on the money.
Diane Simmons: Isn't he brilliant?
Lois: No! He's not brilliant! Rodgers and Hammerstein were brilliant! And I want to do the show they wrote! We're not making any more changes!
Meg: We sold out!
Chris: Yeah. The whole town's talking about your show, Dad!
ALL: [Cheering]
Lois: Your show? Peter, this is my show!
Peter: What's the big deal? You wanted to sell out, and we did.
Lois: I am through selling out. I took this job because I wanted to create something beautiful and you've completely destroyed that! You want to be the director? Fine! I quit!
Peter: Me, direct? I don't know what to say.

Monkey 1: Uh, let's see. A 'something' by any other name...
Monkey 2: Carnation, peony.
Monkey 3: No, they did that on last week's Marlowe.
Monkey 4: What about daisy?
Monkey 5: Chrysanthemum!
Monkey 2: Iris, rose? What about rose?
Monkey 1: Did you say rose?
Monkey 4: Yeah, rose. Rose is good!
Monkey 1: A rose by any other name. That works.
Monkey 4: I like that a lot.
Monkey 1: Moving on.
Monkey 5: Hey, what about tulip?
Monkey 1: Rose is fine. Moving on.

Peter: Morning, theater fans!
Lois: Good morning, Peter. I made your favorite breakfast.
Peter: What the hell is this?
Lois: French toast. I just made a few creative changes to the recipe. I think it's a lot better now.
Peter: Lois, if this is your idea of a joke, you must write for Leno.
Stewie: Oh, oh! You know, it is so fashionable to take a shot at Jay Leno. Look, the fact is the man is out there every bloody night with fresh material and he's charming.
Peter: Face it, Lois, you're just jealous because people like my ideas better than yours.
Lois: I don't care if the whole world loves your ideas. That doesn't make them good. I was trying to make art.
Peter: Oh, art. Put enough monkeys in a room with a typewriter they'll produce Shakespeare.
Lois: Peter, you've never done a creative thing in your life!
Peter: That's not true. I wrote Bonfire of the Vanities.
Lois: No, you didn't.
Peter: You win this round, Lois.
Lois: You're not being creative. You're just destroying a wonderful show.
Peter: Hey, I have more creativity in my whole body than most people do before 9:00 a.m.
Lois: The only thing you create before 9:00 a.m. is exactly what you've turned my show into.
Peter: I think my work will speak for itself. Oh, haha, I just got that. A poop joke? That's real creative, Lois.

Peter: Okay, let's run this scene again. Now, remember, Diane, you're playing Anna, a steel-town girl on a Saturday night looking for the fight of her life.
Diane Simmons: Where does it say that?
Peter: In my noodle. Okay, places. And action!

Peter: Stop! All wrong! All wrong! God, send me dancers.
Diane Simmons: We've been rehearsing for hours. I'm exhausted!
Peter: Well, I'm sorry, but we open this show in three hours and I don't think we're ready!
Diane Simmons: Of course we're not! You keep changing everything!
Peter: You bet I do! Because theater is alive. It's a living, breathing creature with wants and needs and you're not man enough to satisfy her!
Diane Simmons: I can't work this way. I quit!
Peter: Fine.
Joe: We can't do The King and I without Anna.
Quagmire: Yeah. This is a real snafu.
Peter: We don't need Diane Simmons. We've had someone better all along. Someone radiant and sassy, with the soul and passion that can only come from hundreds of years of black oppression.
Loretta: Thank you, Peter. I'll do it.
Peter: Get over yourself. I was talking about me.

Brian: Su-su-sudio. Su-su-sudio.
Stagehand: Two minutes, everybody. Two minutes.
Brian: Fe-fe-fo-fo.
Peter: Jeez, full house. Well, well, look who came crawling back.
Joe: Peter, have you seen my wheelchair?
Chris: I don't get it, Mom. If you're mad at Dad for wrecking your show, why'd you come to opening night?
Lois: I came because I love the theater. I mean, if I just came here to enjoy watching your father be humiliated when this asinine spectacle of his is ridiculed by everyone in town what kind of person would I be?
Chris: A bitch.

Peter: [voiceover] Siam, 2015 AD. The city lies in ruins after the ninth nuclear World War. It is a grim future with lots of explosions and partial nudity. A future where an oppressive new king has seized power. Only one man can stop him. No one machine.
Peter: I am an Automaton Nuclear Neo human Android. You may call me ANNA. I am a robot ninja from the planet England who is here to destroy you and free this land from your tyranny.
Brian: I have been expecting you, ANNA. Allow me to introduce my Siamese children.

Peter: I will not be swayed by your attempts to confuse my programming with your all female sex orgy. We must kung fu fight!
Brian: So be it, ANNA.

Peter: I have slain the evil emperor. I hereby proclaim Siam the United States of America [Crowd cheering]
Lois: Oh, my God! They liked it? Stop it! Stop clapping right now! What's wrong with you? These people shouldn't be encouraged! They should be punished! That man has committed murder here this evening, and the victim's name is theater. This is the kind of mind numbing schlock that's turning our society into a cultural wasteland! This isn't art! This isn't even entertainment! This... blows! [Gasps]
Peter: Uh... [Farting] [Continues farting] [Laughing] [Cheering]
Lois: See? This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about.

Lois: How was the cast party?
Peter: We're a hit. Man, what a night. I got to see my ideas come to life. It's the greatest feeling in the world.
Lois: Yeah, I bet it is.
Peter: And it's all thanks to you. I never would've discovered I could be creative if you hadn't believed in me.
Lois: Well, actually I didn't, really, not at first. But anyone who could take The King and I and turn it into that is... well, he's gotta be creative.
Peter: Yeah, Lois, sorry I took your show away from you. But I'll do whatever it takes to make sure you get your chance next year. It'll be Peter Griffin presents a Lois Griffin production. Okay, honey?
Lois: Deal.
Peter: [chuckling] Hey, were you there when I farted?

Woman: Boy, that lotion sure feels good.
Woman 2: Sure is hot!
Woman: And it just got hotter! Here, now let me do you.
Announcer: Pawtucket Patriot Beer. If you buy it, hot women will have sex in your backyard.
Lois: Typical male fantasy, women drinking beer. I guarantee you a man made that commercial.
Peter: Of course a man made it. It's a commercial, Lois, not a delicious Thanksgiving dinner.
 
Chris: Dad, we won a boat! We won a boat!
Peter: Holy crap! We did! We won a free freakin' boat!
Meg: Dad, nobody gives things away for free.
Peter: That's not true. I know plenty of people who give things away.
Lois: I knew there was a catch. You have to sit through one of those awful time-share presentations.
Peter: Oh. that's a small price to pay. I am gonna be the first one on Spooner Street to have his own boat!
Quagmire: Whoa! All hands on deck! I'm getting a boat!
Cleveland: Hey, Quagmire. I'm also getting a boat, too.
Joe: Right on! Whoo! I can't wait to get my sea legs! Yeah!
Peter: Well, at least I'll be the fattest guy on Spooner Street to get a boat.
Fat Albert: Hey, hey, hey! I'm getting a boat!
Peter: Oh, man! Even Della Reese is getting a boat.

Salesman: These wonderful homes on this beautifully secluded island can be yours with almost no strings attached. Beautiful island. Nothing out of the ordinary here. Just beautiful homes and nothing else. Each residence has 200 feet of pristine oceanfront. No city noise, no flesh-eating ogres, no pollution.
 
Lois: I hate these high-pressure sales situations.
Peter: Oh, that's so cute. You're just afraid that because you're a woman you're gonna do something stupid like buy that time-share, or not realize that your husband taped over our wedding video with softcore cable porn.
Lois: You taped over our wedding video?
Peter: Relax, Lois. I just taped over the boring stuff.
Lois: Oh, my God, Peter! I sent a copy of that tape to my Great Aunt Lil!

Jim Kaplan: Hello, Mr. And Mrs.... Griffin. Now, I know you've been here all day. So, if you'll sign this contract without reading it, I'll take your blank check and you won't not be not loving your time-share before you know it.
Peter: Oh ho, look slick, we're not gonna buy your lousy time-share, all right? Now, where's my boat?
Jim Kaplan: Hold on! You have a choice. You can have the boat or the mystery box.
Lois: Are you crazy? We'll take the boat.
Peter: Not so fast, Lois. A boat's a boat. But the mystery box could be anything. It could even be a boat. You know how much we wanted one of those.
Lois: Then let's just...
Peter: We'll take the box.

Lois: We'll take the box. You gave up a boat for free tickets to a crappy comedy club.
Peter: Come on, Lois! You're acting like this is the first time I've ever done something stupid. You remember the time I was supposed to get that boat?
Lois: Peter, that just happened 10 minutes ago.
Peter: Who cares? I'll bet nobody took the boat. Who could resist the call of the mystery box?
Cleveland: Yahoo!
Quagmire: Hey, look at me. I'm the man in the boat. All right.
Bonnie: Joe, look to the right. It's the Griffins.
Joe: We're nautical now, baby, that's called starboard. But I'll forgive you, because you sex me up. Now, give me some sugar. Hey, neighbors! Where's your boat?
Lois: We didn't take the boat. We took the mystery box. Hop in.

Cleveland: Hey, Quagmire. Maybe the comedian will tell some jokes about boats or boating or owning a boat.
Quagmire: Yeah. Or maybe he'll tell some jokes about being a sucker!
Cleveland: Oh, Quagmire. You're what the Spaniards call terrible.
Brian: What are you so upset about? I never even knew you liked boats.
Peter: Hey, hey, boating's in my blood. Ever since my great-grandfather, Huck Griffin, rafted down the mighty Mississippi.
 
Jim: What did you just call me?
Huck Griffin: I thought that was your name.
Jim: That is our word! You've got no right using it!
Huck Griffin: Hey, I'm cool, I'm cool. No problem. Could you pass me the oar, Jim?
Jim: Thank you.

Peter: [drunk] This comic sucks! He couldn't make me laugh, even if I was laughing my ass off and he was making me do it. Come on, Skinny! Make me laugh!
Lois: Peter, that's a microphone stand.
Peter: Oh, well, pardon me for thinking a microphone stand in a comedy club should tell a joke or two. I guess I'm just old-fashioned that way.
Comedian: Hi. Welcome to...
Peter: [fake laugh] Very funny.
Comedian: Excuse me, sir. I haven't even...
Peter: Oh, oh, that one was hilarious! That was even funnier than your first joke! Hey, put skinny back up there.
Lois: Peter!
Comedian: You think this is easy? You want to come up here and try this?
Peter: I thought you'd never ask.
Brian: Uh, Peter, maybe you shouldn't do this. You've never had a lot of luck telling jokes.
Peter: Don't worry. I got it under control. [on stage] Hey, how about that Viagra, huh? You know what that stuff does, huh? Huh? Come on! What are you people, stupid? You like a little abuse, huh? Yeah. Well, you guys are stupid and ugly. If there was a stupid and ugly contest, you'd all win! Or lose. Whichever is funnier.

Peter: Hey. Hey, Lois. What do you call a woman who takes forever to cook breakfast?
Lois: I swear to God, Peter!
Peter: You call her Lois. [Laughing]
Stewie: [laughing] Well, the fat man made a funny. I rather enjoyed that. Yes, yes, you cook very slowly. As a matter of fact, if you were any slower at cooking you... well, you wouldn't be cooking very fast at all, now, would you? That one wasn't very good.
Lois: Peter, they were laughing at you because it looked like you peed yourself, not because they liked your jokes.
Peter: Well, maybe that was part of my act. Urine happens to be very edgy. But I guess an unfunny person like you wouldn't understand that.
Stewie: Okay, okay. I've got it. If you cooked any more slowly, you wouldn't need an egg timer, you'd need an egg calendar! [Laughing] Oh, that's right. I went there.

Peter: Okay, okay, okay, wait, here's another one. Why do women have boobs? So you got something to look at while you're talking to them!
Men: [Laughing] Good one, Peter. That's what they're for, all right.
Woman: Are you telling jokes? I love jokes.
Peter: All right. Then you'll love this one. Okay. Why do women have boobs? So you got something to look at while you're talking to them. So you got something to look at while you're talking to them. So you got..

Peter: You wanted to see me, Mr. Weed?
Mr. Weed: Peter, we have a problem.
Gloria Ironbox: Mr. Griffin, I'm Gloria Ironbox. I represent one of your coworkers, Sarah Bennett. She's suing you and the company for sexual harassment.
Peter: Sarah, Sarah... I don't... oh, is she the one we videotaped taking a dump? Why? What happened?
Gloria Ironbox: Sexual harassment is a very serious charge, Mr. Griffin.
Peter: All right, look, first of all, if I can speak in my own defense, all I did was tell a little joke. Second of all, women are not people. They are devices built by the Lord Jesus Christ for our entertainment.
Mr. Weed: Peter, please! Miss Ironbox, I assure you, this company in no way condones Peter's conduct. In fact, a film on employee relations has been a mandatory part of our personnel training for 50 years.

Gloria Ironbox: Mr. Weed, I teach a workplace sensitivity training class for men. If Mr. Griffin completes my course, we'll drop the lawsuit.
Mr. Weed: I assure you, Peter will be there. His job depends on it.
Gloria Ironbox: Good. I'm looking forward to it.
Peter: You know, If I wasn't so sure you were a lesbian, I'd say you were coming on to me.

Gloria Ironbox: All right, now, let's do some role-playing. I'll be the office assistant. Mr. Henson, why don't you play the boss, and we'll see what you've learned tonight?
Mr. Henson: Okay.
Gloria Ironbox: The filing is done, Mr. Henson.
Mr. Henson: Thank you, Miss Ironbox. You are a valued member of our business team, and every bit as important to this company as I am.
Gloria Ironbox: Excellent. Mr. Griffin, why don't you come up here and give it a try?
Peter: All right.
Gloria Ironbox: The filing's done, Mr. Griffin.
Peter: Thank you, Miss Ironbox. You are a valued member of our business team, and I will give you a raise tomorrow if you come to work without a shirt on.
Gloria Ironbox: Mr. Griffin!
Peter: I'm sorry. That came out wrong. Let me try again. Nice ass.
Gloria Ironbox: You haven't heard a word I've said!
Peter: Now that's not fair. I've heard everything you said. It's just, you know, there's some subtleties to the rules that aren't so easy to understand. Honk honk.
Gloria Ironbox: Okay, that's it! Obviously, normal sensitivity training isn't enough for you! No, we're gonna have to do something drastic.

Peter: A week at a women's retreat. What the hell am I supposed to learn from that?
Brian: Well, face it, Peter. Your attitude towards women isn't exactly enlightened.
Lois: Peter, I think this'll be good for you. You know I love you, but I have to admit, there are times when I wish you were a little more sensitive and.... Look at me! Look at me!
 
Miss Watson: Hello, ladies. I'm Miss Watson, director of the retreat. I'd like to welcome Peter Griffin, who's here to get in touch with his feminine side. This world would be a far better place if there were more men like him.
Peter: Okay, okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I'll be Charlie, and you can all be my Angels. Except you. You'll be Bosley.
Miss Watson: We women have so much strength inside us. If we can endure the pain of childbirth just imagine what else we're capable of!
Women: That's so true. Right on, sister!
Peter: Wah, wah! Come on it's only childbirth. How much can it hurt?
Miss Watson: Peter, it's like taking your bottom lip and stretching it over your head to the back of your neck!
Peter: Come on. You want to hear some horror stories? You wouldn't believe what I had to go through when Lois was pregnant.
Miss Watson: Women are conditioned to feel competitive with each other when we should be supportive. Lizzie, I know you feel alone and unattractive since your husband left you. But you are a beautiful person, and I am here for you. Notice I'm making physical contact with her in order to establish a connection.
Peter: I think you'd make even more of a connection if you hugged her, too.
Miss Watson: Very good, Peter. That's true.
Peter: That's it. Now rub her back. Okay, that's good. Yeah, yeah, comfort her. Yeah, oh yeah, you like that, don't you? Yeah, it's okay. It's okay to like it. It's very natural. Okay, good. Good. Now smell her a little.

Woman: I can't do it!
Miss Watson: Yes, you can! Trust your sisters! Jump into the trust quilt!
All: Jump! Jump! Trust us! We love you! We'll catch you!
Miss Watson: Wonderful.
Peter: Okay! Me next! Me next! Okay, ladies. I'm gonna start with a triple jump and tuck into a flying move. [Screaming]
Miss Watson: Now that you've felt a woman's pain, the learning can begin.
 
Lois: Welcome back, Peter.
Peter: Lois! I missed you so much! And my babies! Chris, be a munchkin, and bring my bags inside, huh?
Brian: Peter, you're...
Peter: Brian, put the tea on. I have stories. But first, I'm gonna go freshen up and rinse out a few things. Oh, fudge. I broke a nail. Excuse me.
Chris: Oh, my God. Dad's a chick.
Lois: I can't remember the last time we cuddled like this.
Peter: I can't remember the last time I loved you so much!
Lois: How did you get so sweet?
Peter: When I was born, my mommy dunked me in a barrel of sugar.
Brian: Oh, for God's sake!

Quagmire: Hello?
Peter: Hey, Quagmire.
Quagmire: Hey, Peter. What's up?
Peter: Not much.
Quagmire: Well, what do you want?
Peter: Nothin'. I'm just calling to talk. Whatcha thinking about?
Quagmire: What do you mean, what am I thinking about? You called me!
Peter: I just wanted to say hi. So, what are you...

Peter: Sometimes I just can't believe we could make something so beautiful.
Lois: He looks just like his father.
Peter: I really appreciate all the hard work you did giving birth and mothering our kids. I'll never know that joy.
Lois: Peter, I'm sure you would've been a great mother if you had the chance.
Peter: You think so?
Lois: I know so.
Stewie: [Suckling] [Suckling] [shuddering] [Choking and gagging]

Lois: You know, one of these days, I'm gonna need the mirror.
Peter: Oh, beans! I can't get this spit curl to.... Lois, what day is it?
Lois: Thursday.
Peter: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I'm late!
Lois: If you spent less time fixing your hair...
Peter: No, Lois. I'm late! Do we still have that pregnancy test?
Lois: Are you insane? You can't have a baby!
Peter: Well, I don't have a lot of options. I'm Catholic! God, I thought you'd be happy!

Peter: Oh! Oh, this is just great! Now my own wife is forced to cook dinner for her lousy husband?
Lois: Peter, you're my husband! At least you used to be.
Stewie: Oh, mother, I come bearing a gift. I'll give you a hint. It's in my diaper, and it's not a toaster.
Lois: Meg, can you change Stewie?
Meg: Fine. But this time, if a boy calls, please don't tell him I'm wrist deep in poopie.

Lois: Honey, I'm glad you discovered your feminine side. But I didn't want you to forget about mine. Remember this? Remember?
Peter: Oh, my God! That reminds me! I gotta give myself a breast exam. Uh-oh. Uh-oh! A lump! A lump! Oh, God! Oh, God! Nope, Cheeto.

Quagmire: Lois! How expected.
Lois: Hi, Glenn. I'm sorry to bother you. Is this a bad time?
Quagmire: Never a bad time when you're with the Quagmire. Come on in.
Lois: Well, as you may have noticed, Peter's been acting a little different lately. It was refreshing at first. But now... well, he doesn't even treat me like a woman anymore.
Quagmire: I know where this is going, Lois! And I'm already semi there. Oh!
Lois: Anyways, Glenn, I was wondering if you and Cleveland could help change Peter back to the way he was.
Quagmire: Of course that's why you're here! Don't worry, Lois. I'd do everything to you.
Lois: What?
Quagmire: I'd do anything for you.

Quagmire: Come on, Cleveland. If we're gonna fix Peter, we need to surround him with chicks! Let's blow this sausage fest and hit the club.
Cleveland: No. He needs to learn how to respect his fellow man. That's what this march is all about. Respect for your fellow man.
Peter: I can't respect men. Men are the reason our world is in such lousy shape. If men were as caring as women, we wouldn't have crime or violence.
 
Jesse Jackson: My brothers, we need to stand together...
Peter: Excuse me! I'd like to say a couple of truths to the men in this audience. It's your fault we have so much crime in this country! And it's your fault we have so much violence in this country! You are ruining our society, and you should be ashamed!

Peter: Look, I don't care how many letters we gotta write. It should be on for three hours. I mean, you just get going, and boom, it's gone.
Lois: Can we go soon?
Peter: Not yet. Gloria Ironbox and Camille Paglia are gonna see whose is bigger.
Gloria Ironbox: Peter, I'm so glad you could make it.
Peter: Gloria, this is my life partner, Lois.
Lois: I'm his wife.
Gloria Ironbox: His wife. Yes. Peter tells me you don't have a career of your own.
Lois: Oh, no. Life outside my kitchen is so bright and scary. I'm just here because you caught me between pregnancies.
 
Gloria Ironbox: Well, I'm sorry you're so hostile toward someone who's fighting so a woman like you can become more than just a housewife.
Lois: Oh, just a housewife? Look, I'm all for equality but if you ask me, feminism is about choice. I choose to be a wife and mother. And now I'm choosing to end this conversation.
Gloria Ironbox: No wonder your husband didn't respect women.
Lois: Excuse me?
Gloria Ironbox: I can't imagine how screwed up your kids must be.
Lois: You bitch!
 
Lois: That was wonderful.
Peter: Who said that? Oh, hi, Lois. I'm starving. How about a sandwich?
Lois: Glad to have you back, Peter.
Peter: Lois, less talkie, more fetchie.
Lois: I'm just gonna assume that's Chinese for I love you.

Lois: We need to talk about...
Peter: Not now. The show's about to start.
Peter: Lois, are you crazy?
Chris: Yeah, me and Dad haven't missed a show yet.
Lois: Well, you're gonna miss this one, young man. His report card came today. No more TV until your grades improve. Now get upstairs and study.
Peter: Don't worry. I'll talk to her. After I get a little bit of courage from my old friend, Mr. Jack Daniels. Mrs. Daniels? MRS. DANIELS?!? Is Jack in? What? Oh, my God! When? Oh, I am so sorry. Poor old Jack. He was a wise man, but he just loved playing with that wheat thresher. Always playing with that wheat thresher!
 
Lois: Honey, hold still and let me bathe you. You're filthy.
Stewie: I'm filthy? I'm filthy? You're the filthy one. What do you say to that? How dare you!
Lois: [Sighs]
Peter: Hey, Stewie, I see your bum.
Stewie: Oh, take a good look, fat man. And while you're at it, take pictures so I'll have something to bring to court, you wretched, filthy pervert.
Peter: Hey, Lois, give Chris a break. I mean, no TV? So he failed a class. It's not like he felt up his cousin in the garage that Thanksgiving when I was 19.
Lois: Peter, I want you to help Chris. Kids do better when parents take an interest in their schoolwork. I saw that on a two-part report on Dateline Tuesday.
Peter: What the hell is Tuesday.
Lois: Oh, NBC invented a new day so they could add another Dateline.
Peter: But the show is sacred to us. They have the kind of father son relationship I want me and Chris to have someday.
Lois: Peter, they are brothers.
Peter: Oh, nice, Lois. Just because they're black, we can't learn anything from them?
Lois: Look if Chris gets his homework done, you can watch it together next week. Now come on. Help me get the house ready for my mother. She's coming to visit for exactly one week.

Lois: Bye, Mom.
Peter: Sheesh. What a week that was, huh?
Peter: Okay, come on, let's watch the show.
Lois: Peter, I thought we agreed, no TV until his homework is done.
Chris: Mom, I'll do it after...
Peter: Chris finished his homework. In fact, I've been helping him study every night this week.
Lois: Really? Well, that's great. Enjoy your show, boys.
Peter: You bet we will. Tonight, someone guest stars as a very perky crack whore.
Chris: Hey, Dad? When you said, Chris finished his homework, were you talking about me? Because if you were, I think you just lied to Mom.
Peter: Chris, everything I say is a lie, except that and that. And that. And that. And that. And that. And that. And that.
 
Tom Tucker: This is an Action News 5 News Break. I'm Tom Tucker.
Diane Simmons: And I'm Diane Simmons. Tom has dared me to do the news topless. I've got the goods, but have I got the guts? Find out at 11:00.
Tom Tucker: And if you're settling in to watch the show, you're out of luck. That show has been canceled. The full story, and maybe Diane's boobs, tonight at 11:00.
Peter: I can't believe this!
Chris: I feel sick.
Peter: Only one thing to do, Chris. We gotta save the show, and we're gonna do it in style. Let's roll!
Chris: I'm with ya, Dad. What do are we going to do, write a letter?
Peter: No, no, I tried that once. It got me in a lot of trouble.
 
Peter: If you don't put him back on the air, I'll be really upset. The skillful acting of Lois will be missed a lot. Signed, Peter Griffin.
Lois: Peter, come help me with the groceries.
Peter: Okay, honey. [Ominous instrumental music]
Peter: Who are you!

Peter: Okay, Chris, we're gonna get our show back on the air and were not gonna be intimidated by any slick executive types. Ooh, look at Mr. Suave.
Receptionist: Wait. You can't go in there.
Peter: Just watch me!
Receptionist: No, I mean you can't go in there, because that door leads nowhere. Use the door next to it.
Peter: All right, Callaghan, me and my son want you to uncancel the show.
Mr. Callaghan: Well, sir, we only air the show. We have nothing to do with it being canceled. I have all the episodes on tape. Would you like to borrow them?
Peter: Okay, you bastard, you want to play rough? Until you bring the show back, I am going on a hunger strike. How about that, Callaghan? Can you live with that on your conscience? Huh? You gonna eat that stapler?
Mr. Callaghan: Well, you can't eat a stapler...
Peter: Wanna split it?

Peter: Sorry, Chris. Me and my damn appetite! This isn't the first time it's gotten me in to trouble.

Peter: Chris, I just thought of a way to get the show back on the air.
Chris: All right, Dad!
Peter: All we gotta do is tell a little white lie. Just go with it. [dials phone] Is this the Grant a Dream foundation? My son Chris is dying!
Chris: Holy crap, no! Oh, my God!
Peter: That was the lie.
Chris: Oh, you sly boots. [Cheery instrumental music]

Chris: Are you sure this will work?
Peter: Chris, this is just another one of your crazy schemes.
Chris: This whole thing was your idea!
Peter: You'll find out.
Chris: Dad, you're not making any sense!
Peter: You just leave that to me.
Harris: Ah, yes. Here we go. Chris Griffin. Your dying wish is denied. Thank you!
Peter: Wait a minute. My son only has a short time to live. All he wants is his favorite show back on TV. How can you say no?
Harris: Mr. Griffin, everyone thinks their dying child is special. But these days, people who donate money to our foundation demand a little more bang for their buck. We need sick kids we can package. You know, like that one we put on Hollywood Squares.
 
Contestant: I'll take the dying boy to block.
Host: Okay. Jeremy, is there anything lower than absolute zero?
Jeremy: Uh, yeah. My white-cell count. [Audience laughing]
 
Peter: I'm telling you, Chris is dying ten times worse than those other kids. He's got a very rare disease called tumor.
Harris: Sounds sexy. What are the symptoms?
Peter: What are the symptoms? Take a look! He's growing nipples all over his body!
Harris: They look like pepperonis.
Peter: Who do you think you are? My son happens to be very sensitive about his extra nipples. See, look. They're coming right off. Nipples shouldn't just come off like that.
Harris: Why, that's the sickest boy I've ever seen! Get me the president of television! [Spectacular instrumental music]
 
Man 1: How about this? A single white girl in the city working at a magazine!
ALL: Yeah, that's good. That's at least a twelve share.
Man 2: Do you guys hear yourselves? This is the same old crap over and over again. We need to take a chance. Try something different. Something fresh.
Receptionist: Excuse me.
Executive: No calls!
Receptionist: It's about a dying boy.
Executive: Hello? Well, what's he got? Sounds sexy. Get me exclusive rights to his death and you got a deal.
Harris: Well, congratulations, the show is back on the air!
Chris: All right, Dad!
Harris: Mr. Griffin, I'm sorry we had to meet under these circumstances.
Peter: Are you kidding? I may see you again. I got two more kids at home, and I've always wanted to see some new episodes of Star Trek.

Lois: Stewie, it's bath time. You're filthy again.
Stewie: I'll show you filthy! Yes, look at me! I'm a dirty, foul little boy! I'm a nasty, squalid little hobo! I say, Mother, you have your work cut out for you now, don't you?
Lois: Okay, if you want to be dirty, be dirty.
Stewie: Where do you think you're going? I've defiled myself. I need to be cleaned! Aah!
Peter: There you go, kiddo. All clean.
Stewie: Blast! I'm frozen! I'm hypothermic! Bloody hell, I'm a woman!

Mr. McCloud: Take out your pencils and start your test.
Chris: Uh, Mr. McCloud, I didn't study for the test, but I got a good reason. I'm dying.
Mr. McCloud: Griffin, that's the lamest excuse I've heard since Steinberg's Jewish High Holiday crap. Steinberg! Take that hat off in my classroom!
Chris: But Mr. McCloud, I'm really dying. I have a certificate to prove it.
Mr. McCloud: My God! Tumor! And he still comes into school! You're excused from the test, you brave, brave boy. Steinberg, you can learn something from this fine young... damn it, Steinberg! Take that hat off!
 
Meg: Dad, Marcy Gibbons just called and she heard that Chris is dying! [crying]
Peter: [Laughing] Your brother's okay. That was just a little white lie me and Chris came up with to save a TV show.
Meg: So, he's not going to die?
Peter: No! [Laughing] Boy, your face was priceless when you thought he was. [Pretending to cry]
Brian: You're a monster.
Peter: Hey, Chris was in on the whole thing. Anyway, it's over and done with. [Guitar playing folk music]
Peter: What the hell is that?
 
Lois: Do I hear singing?
Peter: Nope! No singing. Just us watching another hilarious episode of Good Times. You know, the sitcom that's funnier when you play it really loud.
Lois: That is singing. Peter, there's a candlelight vigil on our front lawn.
Peter: Lois, that's ridiculous. There's nobody out there. You must be seeing things.
Lois: Peter, why are these people here?
Chris: As they dig my grave, as they dig my grave? Hey, Dad, they're singing a song about me! Oh, hi, Mom. [Doorbell rings]
 
Harris: Hello, Mr. Griffin. We just came by to see if your son's taken a media-friendly turn for the worse.
Peter: No. Everything's fine. Thanks for checking. Bye-bye.
Harris: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Mr. Griffin, the foundation held up its end of the bargain and got that crappy show back on the air! You owe us a body!
Lois: What?
Peter: Uh, excuse me for a minute.
Lois: You pretended Chris was dying to save a TV show? You're a monster!
Brian: Thank you.
Lois: Peter. You tell that man the truth!
 
Peter: Uh, just out of curiosity...
Harris: Shoot.
Peter: What happens if he's not really dying?
Harris: You go to jail for defrauding a charitable organization.
Peter: Oh, that's interesting. Will you excuse us? You're right! There's only one way out of this! Chris is all better! I cured him!
Harris: You cured him?
Peter: That's right. I have divine powers! Okay. Safe drive. Well, what do you have to say to that? I'm not going to jail, Chris doesn't have to die, and best of all, the show is back on the air.
Lois: Oh, you're a great role model, Peter. What kind of man devalues the life of his child for a TV show?
Peter: Lois, anyone who wouldn't pretend their own son is dying to get the show back on TV is a racist. There, I said it. [Cheery instrumental music]
 
Woman: It's him! It's Peter Griffin! The miracle healer of Quahog! Oh, heal me, O great one!
Lois: You see what your lies have gotten youe? They think you're some kind of healer.
Peter: I'll handle it, Lois. I read a book about this sort of thing once.
Brian: Are you sure it was a book? Are you sure it wasn't nothing?
Peter: Oh, yeah.
Lois: Peter, these poor, deluded people think you have divine powers.
Man 1: Praise Peter!
Woman 1: We are your servants.
Woman 2: It's a miracle!
Man 2: What would you have us do, O great healer of Quahog?
Peter: Well, there's really no need to do anything... paint my house.
Lois: Peter, it's bad enough to lie to your family, but how can you let these people think you're a healer? This is pure exploitation.
Peter: No, it's not. Those films my cousin Rufus used to do were pure exploitation.

Peter: Come on, Lois. Stop being such a stick in the mud. Look, I'm giving these saps hope. And I'm getting the house painted for free. It's win-freakin'-win, baby. [Cheery instrumental music]
 
Peter: Hey, flathead, chop-chop.
Man: [Exclaiming]
Man 2: [Sighing]
Peter: Hey, great job on the lawn. Now do it again, and this time leave it a little longer.
Chris: Hey, Dad. Hurry up. You're missing the show. They caught the guy, and now they're interviewing him.
Peter: Some other time, Chris. Now, where's my shoes? [Sighing]
 
Lois: Peter, these people are worshipping you. Don't you think there's someone who might resent that? A being who's all knowing and all powerful?
Peter: Well, someone's got a pretty high opinion of herself.
Lois: Not me, Peter. God. The real God.
Peter: Look, what's the big deal? So I told a little fib, and now people think I'm God. I mean, when did God ever say He didn't want someone else being worshipped like Him?
Lois: It's one of the Ten Commandments.
Peter: Oh, come on, Lois. Those were written, like, 200 years ago. Times have changed!
Lois: [screams]
Peter: Okay, let's stay calm.
Peter: Ah, Lois, if you're scared, I'll hold you close until the lights are on again.
Chris: Dad, it's me.
Peter: Go to your room.
Lois: Well, that's the last of them. I still don't know how every light bulb could go out at the same time. Oh, my God.
Peter: Yes?
Lois: Peter, that's not funny. Those fanatics are building a golden idol of you on our lawn.
Peter: Wow, I look like a freakin' Emmy. Hint-hint.
Brian: Ah! Damn it to hell! This is embarrassing. I seem to have fleas.
Lois: That's never happened before.
Chris: Morning.
Peter: Geez, Chris, puberty hit you like a ton of bricks.
Chris: What do you mean? Ah!
Lois: Don't you see what's happening?
Peter: Of course I do, Lois. Our fresh-faced little boy is becoming a pock-marked, hideously disfigured man. Sunrise. Sunset.
Brian: No, no, no, Peter. The light bulbs last night, my fleas, Chris' pimples. They're just like darkness, gadflies, and boils. Three of the plagues God visited upon Egypt when the Pharaoh angered him in the Old Testament.
Peter: Oh, come on, Brian, there's a logical explanation for all those things. There was a power surge, you don't bathe, and Chris has had acne problems since the fourth grade. Ah, the kids were all alling him Crisco and Pizza Face and Rootin'-Tootin' Raspberry. Remember, Chris?
Chris: Now I do. [Crying]
Meg: [screams]
Lois: Meg, what's wrong?
Meg: I was giving Stewie a bath, and... and....
Peter: Trust me, Meg, at his age, it's strictly involuntary.
Meg: No! The water, it turned all red and goopy, like blood!
Lois: Blood?
Stewie: How positively delightful. It's as if someone stabbed Mr. Bubble!
Lois: My baby! Get out there and tell those people the truth. Make them stop worshipping you before it starts hailing in my house!
Peter: There's gotta be an explanation for all this!
Brian: You want an explanation? God. Is. Pissed!
Peter: Ah! Let's get out of here! [Eerie instrumental music] [Sinister instrumental music]
 
Peter: Stop it! Stop it! Stop worshipping me! I'm just a big fake, like the moon landing and Marky Mark's hog in Boogie Nights, and Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman! Oh, I don't mean that completely untrue gay rumor. They're just both really phony, just like me. I'm sorry, okay? Now make it stop. [All screaming]
Brian: Peter, this is the final plague!
Peter: Good, 'cause this is starting to get really old.
Brian: Peter, the final plague is the death of the first-born son.
Peter: Oh, no! Stewie!
Brian: The first-born son.
Peter: Meg.
Brian: Your wife.
Peter: Chris!
Lois: Chris!
Peter: Oh, my God. Are you okay?
Chris: Hey, Dad, I can see a white light at the end of a long tunnel.
Peter: Oh, that's great, son. Light is good. Run towards the light.
Lois: No, Chris, no! Run away from the light!
Chris: Hey, Dad, do you think they got the show in heaven?
Peter: Yes, son, and there's no reruns or commercials, and Kirstie Alley is still hot and all those scrambled channels come in clear as a bell. Please don't take him, God. I'm sorry.
 
Angel: Sir, we think the Griffin guy gets it.
God: Good, good. Peggy, turn off the plagues, please.
Peggy: Yes, sir, Mr. Patterson.
God: She's new.
 
Brian: I think the plagues went away.
Chris: So did the white light.
Lois: Oh, honey!
Peter: Thank God! I mean, thank me! Kidding! It was a joke! It was a joke! Ah!

Brian: I'm in a rut. Nothing thrills me anymore. I mean, I can't even think of a reason to get off the bed in the morning.
Dr. Kaplan: Really?
Brian: You want to know how pathetic my life is? I've seen that Behind the Music with Leif Garrett 18 times.

Brian: It's like, it's like I'm, I don't know, trapped in my own life.
Dr. Kaplan: Well, Brian, you may be too inwardly focused. Try thinking about the needs of others for a change. Why don't you do some volunteer work?
Brian: That makes sense. Volunteer work. Thanks, Bruce.
Dr. Kaplan: You still have 13 more minutes.
Brian: Oh. Do I? Hmm. I notice you got a new receptionist. Nice little body on her, huh?
Dr. Kaplan: That's my daughter.
Brian: Well, we could probably call this an early day, huh?
 
Mr. Weed: Attention, everyone. Due to several complaints and two deaths related to worker fatigue, I have decided to throw a company picnic this Saturday.
Peter: Hey, Derek, how are you getting to the picnic?
Derek: I don't know. I don't have a ride.
Peter: Hey, John, you got a two-seater, don't you? Hey, Derek, maybe you go with John? Huh?
Derek: For the last time, I'm not gay!
John: Thanks anyway, Peter.
Peter: Hey, we'll get him.

Brian: Here. Right this way. Watch your step. Okay, they're in the woods. The camera keeps on moving. I think they're looking for some witch. I don't know. I wasn't listening. Nothing's happening. Nothing's happening. Something about a map. Nothing's happening. It's over. A lot of people in the audience look pissed.
 
Meg: Now, remember, Chris we have to work together, so that our steps... [screams]
Peter: Aw, this is my favorite event, Catch the Greased Up Deaf guy.
Mr. Weed: Go!
Deaf guy: You're never gonna catch me! You're wasting your time! Forget about it! Go do something else! See you all next year!
 
Brian: King me.
Elderly woman: I don't want to play anymore. The pain. I can't live like this, Brian. I need you to pull the plug.
Brian: I can't.
Elderly woman: Be my angel and set me free. Please? Oh, my God! You were really gonna do it! Nurse, this dog is trying to kill me! Nurse!
Brian: You are twisted, lady! You hear me? You are screwed up in the head!

Mr. Weed: The winner of our final contest will receive a very special prize. A week's paid vacation!
Peter: Did you hear that? Oh, God, please, let it be farting. Please let it be a fart contest.
Mr. Weed: These are tranquilizer darts. I have enough here to take down Robert Downey Jr. Robert Downey, yes, well, the last one left standing wins. Let the game begin!
Chris: All right, Dad!
Lois: Go, Peter!
Stewie: Look at him! He runs like a Welshman. Doesn't he? Doesn't he run like a Welshman?
 
Toucan Sam: Follow your nose. Follow your nose. Follow your nose.
Brian: [snickers] I'm sorry. No, that was good. I just didn't think you were gonna go so cartoony with it.
Toucan Sam: Well, how would you read it?
Brian: I don't know. I was thinking of doing it, you know, good, like an actor. But, you know, your way's good, too.

Joe: Hey there, Brian.
Brian: Hi, Joe. Hey, Bonnie making chicken marsala tonight?
Joe: No. She made that three nights ago. Wow, that's some nose you got!
Brian: Yeah. One time it almost got me a spokesman deal.
Joe: You know, we could use a nose like that down at the precinct.
Brian: Really?

Johnson: I guess it's just down to you and me, Peter. One of us is gonna win that paid vacation.
Peter: I don't want to feed Grandma bacon while she's in the bathtub.
Johnson: Peter, are you okay? [Engine revving] Mr. Weed, I think Peter needs a doc-oof!
Mr. Weed: We have a winner!
Peter: Here, kitty, kitty.

Brian: No drugs. She's good. He's clean.
Joe: It looks like that's it, except for the flight crew.
Quagmire: Hey, Brian. What's with the Johnny Law routine?
Joe: Say hello to our newest guy. He's a natural.
Quagmire: Oh, yeah? How good are you?
Brian: You're back from Manila. You had lumpia for dinner. Then you made love to two Filipino women... and a man.
Quagmire: You mean three Filipino women! ...No!
Brian: Wait a second. Got something.
Joe: This could be the real deal, boys! Let's do it!
 
Joe: Don't move, dirt bag!
Brian: It's coke! Yes! All right, we've got him! This is great. Ah, this is the rush I've been looking for.
Joe: Good work, Brian. You still got a little...
Brian: Oh, oh. Thanks.

Lois: So, Peter. Where shall we go for your week off?
Peter: I was thinking we could all go to purgatory, like we did last year.
Lois: This isn't bad. It's not that good. But it's not that bad.
Brian: It's so-so.
Peter: More or less.
Peter: Hey, Brian. If cops are pigs, does that make you a Snausage?
Brian: Clever, Peter. Did you stay up all night writing that?
Peter: I got to bed around 2:00, 2:30.
Brian: Do you know what Joe said the street value of that cocaine would've been?
Lois: Let's see. Four and a half kilos uncut Nicaraguan...$1.7 mil, that area?
Brian: Uh, yeah. That's right.
Meg: You guys! Brian's famous!
Lois: You're a hero!
Peter: Way to go, pal!
Brian: Oh, come on. Stop it, you guys. It's nothing, really. Lois. Your toast is ready.
Lois: Oh, my.
Brian: Meg's using a new conditioner.
Meg: He's right!
Peter: How do you like that?
Meg: That's amazing.
Brian: And it's time to change Stewie.
Stewie: That's preposterous. I haven't... oh, there it is. All right.

Brian: Stop the car! Over there. Everybody freeze! This is a bust!
Joe: Brian, this is a Sunday School class.
Brian: The hell it is! Pure Bogota bullion. This is a drug ring.
Joe: But these are just kids.
Brian: Oh, yeah? What's your name?
Ricky: Ricky.
Brian: They're not kids they're midgets! Filthy, drug peddling midgets!
Joe: Oh, my God! Look out, Brian! [Dramatic instrumental music]
 
Joe: Nice work, rookie.
Cop 1: You're a credit to the force.
Cop 2: Additional generic cop compliment, Brian.
Brian: Huh, thanks. But the real hero here is God for blessing me with this nose... and a few other equally amazing appendages.
Joe: Well, I'd better take this cocaine down to Evidence.
Brian: Hey, I'll do that. I'll catch up with you guys at the pub.
 
Lois: So it's settled. We're taking a cruise to the Bahamas!
Peter: Ah, this is gonna be great. Cruises are the best.
Lois: And look. It says we have our choice of cabins, port or starboard. Ha! Listen to me. I sound like an old salt.
Stewie: [Stewie laughs sarcastically] Yes, though I must say, I've always dreamed of a life at sea.

Brian: Sorry to be tardy to the party.
Meg: Wow, Brian. Have you lost weight? You gotta tell me your secret.
Brian: Here's a hint, put down the fork! Face!
Lois: So how was your day?
Brian: My day? Un freakin' believable! First, we nailed this bastard who hid his stuff in his daughter's doll! Her doll, for God's sake! Where's the line anymore? Well, I got news for you. It's not even on the radar screen! The days of decency and virtue are gone, honey! Bam! Freakin' evaporated, like a dingy, stinkin' mud puddle. One day you see your reflection in it and the next day, it's a damn oil spot on your cracked driveway, staring back at you, mocking you blah blah blah knowing the perverted truth that rots in the pit of your soul. That's how my freakin' day was.
Peter: You know what I haven't had in a while? Big League Chew.
 
Brian: So take it from me, McGriffin the Drug Dog, if you really want to get high, it's as easy as being yourself. Well, kids, I'm gonna pass things off now to...vGerald, the Happy and Abstinent Police Clown.
Gerald: Hey, kids! Do you know why I'm happy? Because I'm free of STDs!
Kid 1: That McGriffin guy was so cool!
Kid 2: Totally! I'm never doing drugs now!
Brian: Got milk? [Manic laughter]

Peter: Now, Chris, before you go on a cruise, you gotta build up a base tan.
Chris: But, Dad, I heard that if you use tanning beds, you can get something called melanoma.
Peter: Oh, that's just fancy talk for sexified. Now climb in. Hey, what kind of tanning booth is this?
Man: Can't you read? Those aren't tanning booths. That whole row is time machines!
Peter: Oh, crap! Where the hell is he?
Chris: Hey, Dad, I'm in the Bible days. And there's a whole stadium of people clapping for me. Oh, look. My very own lion!
Peter: Oh, my God! Huh. Must've got the wrong hat.

Joe: Brian, there's no smoking in the terminal.
Brian: Hey, hey, there's worse things than nicotine, pal! And I'm gonna find 'em.
Horowicz: Ah, patience, lad. It took dear St. Patrick more than a day to clear the Emerald Isle of snakes.
Brian: Can the Irish crap, will you, Horowicz?
Horowicz:  Okay.
Brian: Open it!
Man: Let me go! Help! Help!
Brian: All right. Where's the stash? I'll do a freakin' body cavity search, I swear!
Joe: Sir, we apologize. Griffin, there's no easy way to say this. I think you have a drug problem.
Brian: A drug problem? What's this really about? Jealousy? Am I stealing your thunder, Joe, is that it?
Joe: Give me your badge.
Brian: Fine! By the way, Horowicz, you should show Joe your impression of him.
Horowicz: Well, it's not as good as, you know, my Irish cop. It's just a little thing I.... Look at me! I'm Joe! My legs don't work but I make up for it by having a very strong upper body!
Joe: Ha ha ha ha! Well, I do say that.

Lois: Oh, The Old Man and the Sea. I see you're getting in the mood for our cruise.
Peter: Yeah. Stupid fisherman. Sitting out there in a boat yammering to himself. He doesn't even know I'm watching him.
Stewie: Splendid. Fido McCoke Fiend is home.
Brian: Everybody, this is Tina.
Meg: What happened to you?
Brian: How about a little less questions, and a little more shut the hell up?
Stewie: You know, just because you can't feel your teeth, doesn't mean the girl can't feel your insults.
Lois: Hello, I'm Lois Griffin. Welcome to our home.
Tina: So, what? She's like your mom or something?
Lois: Tina, can I get you a warm washcloth to wipe the dried blood from under your nose?
Brian: Here, baby, I'll show you the channel Lois doesn't know about.
Lois: Brian will you, Chris, look away! Meg, take Stewie upstairs!
Stewie: Wait, wait! That man seems to have suffered a rather serious snakebite!
Lois: Brian, would you please ask your new friend to leave now?
Brian: Oh, sorry. Things getting a little too real for the Stepford wife? And look at you two. Quasimodo and Lumpy. I leave more personality in tightly coiled piles on the lawn.
Stewie: Do me! Do me next!
Brian: Come on, baby girl. Let's go to the park.

Brian: Doc. What the hell are you doing here?
Dr. Kaplan: Your family has something they'd like to say to you.
Meg: Brian, I know I don't speak up much and it's really hard for me to talk about my feelings, but...
Dr. Kaplan: Why don't we start with someone more interesting? Peter?
Peter: Brian, ever since your addiction, you've been a jerk. I miss the good old days when you were my sidekick.
Brian: Look, you guys got it all wrong. I'm so sorry, everyone! God. I need help!
Stewie: Well, I guess now we know what kind of dog he is. A melon collie. Nothing? Wait. No. I should've said: Chiwahwah. I don't have to fucking impress you.
 
Peter: Look, I'm not insensitive, Lois. But I just don't see why we gotta cancel our cruise just 'cause the dog's a cokehead.
Lois: We're not going on vacation while Brian's in rehab. We'll just have to wait 'till next year.
Peter: Aw, man!
Brian: Peter, I'll make it up to you. I have a cousin who works at Club Med.

Peter: Holy crap! Look at this place. This is where God would come if he had to stop doing blow.
Meg: They have tennis courts!
Stewie: And a full spa!
Chris: Wow! No wonder people do drugs!
Lois: Good luck, Brian. I just know you're gonna get clean.
Peter: Heck. Shouldn't be too hard to get clean with all these mineral baths and Jacuzzis.
Stewie: Oh, I see. The fat man makes a pun, and everyone wets themselves. I give you gold, and I get squat. I'll be in the car.
 
Doctor: That was a very productive first day, Brian. Our goal here is to find your X factor, the element in your life that made you turn to drugs in the first place.
Brian: Well, just having some time away to sort things out is gonna do wonders. Thanks, Doctor.

Brian: What are you doing here?
Peter: I'm on vacation! Oh, and if anyone asks, I'm also on smack.
Brian: Peter, this is a detox clinic. You can't vacation here.
Peter: Why not? This place is way better than a cruise. You should've seen it. I whipped a speed freak's ass at horseshoes today.
Brian: Peter, this isn't a vacation for me. For God's sake, I'm trying to get healthy!
Peter: Yeah, okay, okay. All right. Hey, softball this afternoon. A bunch of us addicts are taking on the pregnant teenagers from across the lake.
 
Woman: Okay, come on, everyone. Exercise is an important part of recovery. Just work with the resistance of the water. Ten more reps. Okay, and one, and two, and three...
Peter: Yeah! I'm also addicted to boobies!

Peter: I'll trade you this for your cupcake. What? It was just Carpet Fresh. I'm on your side.
Doctor: I've been observing your behavior, and I don't think you're a addict. I think you're an idiot.
Peter: Well, I don't pay you to think, Hot Lips. In fact, I don't pay you at all. Count it!
Doctor: I'll be keeping my eye on you. What's your name?
Peter: My name? Yeah, yeah, Peter Griffin. Oh, crap.

Peter: Hey, Brian, I was looking for you. Hey, you want to go mess with the pregnant teens across the lake?
Brian: I can't. Group therapy, 2:00.
Peter: Oh, man, I peeked in on one of those. It was more boring than when I was a security guard for George Harrison.
Brian: Well, I have been making a lot of progress lately. I guess missing a session wouldn't be the end of the world.
Peter: There you go!

Peter: Hey, what do you think they put in the bug juice?
Brian: Bugs.
Peter: No, they don't! Come on! Shut up!

Doctor: Well, I hope you're proud of yourselves. 14 premature births!
Brian: Sorry, Doc. I don't usually let Peter talk me into this kind of stuff.
Doctor: Wait a minute. Brian, you have a pre-existing relationship with this degenerate?
Peter: A degenerate, am I? Well, you are a boob. See? I can make up words, too, sister.
Doctor: Well, I think we found your X factor.
Brian: What? Do you mean Peter?
Doctor: His behavior is clearly a negative influence on you. With your intelligence and sensitivity, obviously...
Brian: Whoa, hey! I made my own mistakes, all right? This man took me into his home, and he treated me like family. He's my best friend.
Doctor: Yes. And look where you've ended up.
Brian: You know what? I think my therapy here is complete. I came here to get clean, and I did. So good-bye.
Peter: Brian, it's moments like this that make me sad you're gonna die 50 years before I do.
 
Joe: I am serious, Lois. You could be in show business!
Quagmire: Hey, Meg. 18 yet?
Meg: No.
Quagmire: Hey, Chris, how are you?
Chris: Well, I'm glad I...
Quagmire: All right!
Joe: Brian, I feel a little guilty. If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have been exposed to that junk.
Brian: Joe, if I've learned anything from my experience it's that we're all responsible for our own destiny. And that's why I'm leaving.
Peter: Leaving? You can't leave.
Brian: I have to, Peter. For me. I love you all.
Lois: Somebody say something.
Stewie: Brian, wait!
Brian: Hold on a second. Airport, please.

Lois: That's funny. I don't remember buying Stewie these toys. Oh, my God! It all makes sense now. My baby is some kind of diabolical genius bent on world domination!
Stewie: [slow clapping] Bravo, Lois. The last horse finally crosses the finish line.
Lois: Stewie! All these months I should've been paying attention to what you've been saying. You're an evil child. Why? Why did I have to go and smoke pot when I was pregnant with you?
Stewie: Cheer up, Mother. You should be proud. You've given birth to the future emperor of the world. Pity you won't be around to enjoy it. Cheerio!
Lois: [Screams]

Peter: Lois. Lois! What's the matter?
Lois: I just had the strangest dream. Something about Stewie and Cheerios. It's gone.
Peter: Well, come on, get up. It's opening day for the Sox. Hey, Chris, Meg, we're going to Fenway!
Lois: Peter, you can't pull the kids out of school for a baseball game.
Peter: Aw, there's nothing these kids learn in school they can't learn on the street.
 
Gang Member: It's 3:00. Where the hell is Louie?
Gang Member 2: Well, you tell me. Louie left his house at 2:15 and has to travel a distance of 6.2 miles at a rate of 5 miles per hour. What time will Louie arrive?
Gang Member: Depends if he stops to see his ho.
Gang Member 2: That's what we call a variable!

Chris: Look what I made for the game.
Meg: What does that mean, anyway?
Brian: And the Lord said, Go, Sox.
Meg: Dad, don't you have to work today?
Peter: It's nothing a little phone call can't take care of.
Mr. Weed: Hello?
Peter: Mr. Weed? I can't come to work today. I was in a terrible plane crash. My entire family was killed, and I am a vegetable. I'll see you tomorrow. Huh? Huh?
Brian: Oh, please, Peter. Your excuses are lamer than FDR's legs.
All: [Gasping]
Brian: Too soon?

Mom: Here it comes, Jeremy!
Jeremy: I got it! I got it!
Peter: Yes! Yeah! All right! I'm the man! Yeah! Hold on to this, Stewie. It'll be a souvenir of your first major league game with your dad.
Stewie: My God. I shall cherish this forever. I say, Opie, I'll trade you this baseball for your souvenir bat.
Boy: Sure!
Stewie: What did you learn?
Peter: This is great. We haven't done anything together like this since we saw Mike Tyson get beat.

Lois: I'm so glad you talked us all into playing hooky.
Peter: Me, too. Hey, maybe we can get on TV if we take our shirts off and run onto the field.
Lois: Peter, I'm not taking my shirt off.
Peter: [pulls up Lois' shirt] There. Now they're old news.
Lois: Peter!

Peter: Go, Sox! [tumbles down steps] [Screaming] Hmmm.[Snorting hot dog] [Snorting mustard]
Mr. Weed: Peter?
Peter: Oh, uh, hi, Mr. Weed.
Mr. Weed: Well, it seems you've made a full recovery.
Peter: Oh, yeah. That plane crash I told you about, it turned out to be gas.
Mr. Weed: Aha! Liar! Tomorrow, my office, 9:30.

Peter: I'm tired of Mr. Weed treating me like a common doormat. I want him to treat me like one of those deluxe one from Pottery Barn with the fancy straw.
Brian: I don't care for Pottery Barn. Peter, if you want Mr. Weed to respect you, you're gonna have to earn it.
Peter: Hmm, earn it. [Snorting drink]

Mr. Weed: Why have you forsaken me?
Peter: Uh, Mr. Weed? I heard you ran into my identical twin brother at the ball game yesterday. And if you don't buy that, I'm sorry I was at the ball game yesterday.
Mr. Weed: Peter, I just received terrible news. This company has been taken over by a conglomerate. After 23 years of faithful service, I've been terminated!
Peter: Wow, the business world sure is funny.
 
Wally: Hey, Dilbert, what do you call it when a guy in middle management moves all the way to upper management?
Dilbert: I don't know. What do you call it?
Wally: A promotion.
Dilbert: Oh, thanks. Here's a memo.

Executive: And so, on behalf of the El Dorado Cigarette Company I'd like to welcome you to our family. I think you'll be very happy with the changes we've made.
Peter: Aw, this is sweet! Why are you putting a window in the middle of the factory?
Construction worker: So Aunt Bee has a place to let her pies cool.
Aunt Bee: Hello, boys. Today's pie is cherry. It'll be ready just in time for lunch.
Peter: Wow, these guys sure know how to run a company.
Executive: Look how happy those morons are. They'll never realize we're using those toys to get children addicted to our company's cigarettes.
All: [Laughing maniacally]
Executive: [Whistles] Good boy, Connor. Pull.
All: [Laughing maniacally]

Chris: Can't we eat? I'm so hungry I could ride a horse. I don't get it. Well, I could ride it to the store, I guess.
Lois: I told you we're not starting without your father. Dinner just isn't dinner without him.
Stewie: Well, perhaps I could help simulate the experience. [throws face into food] [makes ridiculous noises]
Peter: Hey, family. Anyone in the mood for lobste oh, God! One of them has my pupil! [Screaming]
Brian: Peter, how the hell can you afford lobster on your salary?
Peter: I got a raise.
Brian: What?
Peter: Yeah. The new owners gave everyone raises. Even Kenneth, the bad ass mail clerk with the heart of gold.

Peter: Hi, Kenneth. Hey, did I get any mail?
Kenneth: No! But if you come any closer, I'll slice you!
Peter: Okay! Okay! Man, what a bad ass!
Man: Yeah? That bad ass just gave half his paycheck to orphans. Orphans with diseases!

Peter: And check out the new toys we're making.
Meg: Baby Smokes-A-Lot?
Chris: Cool! That's imitatable!
Brian: What the hell? El Dorado Cigarettes? That's who bought your company?
Lois: Oh, my God! They're trying to corrupt our children!
Brian: Well, what do you expect? Those bastards turned a whole generation of Americans into smokers with their damned subliminal advertising.
 
Lois: Peter, if kids see this doll, they're gonna think smoking's okay. You have to talk to your new bosses first thing in the morning.
Peter: Don't you worry, Lois. I'll set them straight. Just like I did with Chris.
Chris: Dad, what's the blowhole for?
Peter: I'll tell you what it's not for, son. And when I do, you'll understand why I can never go back to Sea World.
 
Peter: Gentlemen, we need to talk. My wife says you're trying to get kids to smoke.
Executive: That's just not true.
Peter: What about this toy?
Executive: Peter, it's just a doll with a cigarette. I mean Barbie has a Dream Car, but you don't see every 8 year old driving. They're just fun toys.
Jerry: Smoke!
Executive: Not now, Jerry. Trust me, Peter. The last thing we want is to get kids to start smoking.
Peter: What about that graph on the wall that says: The first thing we want is to get kids to start smoking?
Executive: That? Oh, that's just something my son made me in art class.
Peter: Then what about that poster that says: The graph was not made in art class. We really do want kids to start smoking?
Executive: Look, we're a caring company. I mean, would you really be the president of a company that didn't care about kids?
Peter: No. But I'm not the president.
Executive: Yes, you are, if you want to be.
Men: [Agreeing]
Peter: Oh, wow. Imagine, me, president. I'll do it!
 
Lois: So how did it go?
Peter: I'm not finished yet. Aren't you gonna ask me how it went?
Lois: Yes! Did you talk to the company executives? Peter, answer me!
Peter: Yeah, I did! They made me president.
Meg: Of the whole company?
Chris: All right, Dad!
Peter: You should've seen the way they were treating me. I never got that kind of respect before.

Peter: Great workout, Bobby.
Boy: Up yours, sack breath!
Peter: That's Mister Griffin.
Lois: But, Peter, why would they make you president?
Peter: Maybe it's because I can recite all 50 states in a quarter of a second. [Yelps]
Lois: Peter, that was just a loud yelping noise.
Peter: Jeez, Lois, I thought you'd be proud of me. After all these years, the company thinks I'm worth something. Wait till you see all the perks we're gonna get.
Meg: Um, hi. Can I help you?
Ugly Girl: Some company hired me to stand next to you so you'd look better by comparison.
Meg: That's ridiculous. I don't need...
Boy: Meg, did you get less ugly?
Meg: Yeah!

Peter: Surprise!
Lois: Everything looks the same.
Peter: Oh, it looks the same, but actually El Dorado Cigarettes has coated the entire inside of the house with a microfilm of Teflon, so it's easy to clean.
Lois: Oh!
Peter: Maybe I shouldn't have had them do the floors.
Stewie: I'm Nudes on Ice!

Lois: This is so exciting. Your father's first day as president.
Peter: Good morning, First Family. Ooh, Lois, what's in this coffee?
Lois: Isn't it wonderful? The company sent Martha Stewart to help me with the housework. I take back all the bad things I said about them. The coffee is delicious, Martha.
Martha Stewart: A little chicory perks up the taste of roasted coffee beans. It's a good thing.
Brian: Well, I think it's a crappy thing! In fact, this is my last cigarette, ever. You make me sick, letting yourselves be bought off with a few lousy perks.
Stewie: Oh, I beg to differ.

Valet: Oh, you don't need to park here, Mr. Griffin. You have an executive parking space now.
Peter: But that looks exactly like my old space.
Valet: Yeah, but this one comes with your own company suck up.
Suck-up: Morning, Mr. Griffin. Nice day.
Peter: It's a little cloudy.
Suck-up: It's absolutely cloudy, one of the worst days I've seen in years. So, good news about the Yankees.
Peter: I hate the Yankees.
Suck-up: Pack of cheatters, that's what they are. I love your tie.
Peter: I hate this tie.
Suck-up: It's awful, it's gaudy, it's gotta go.
Peter: And I hate myself.
Suck-up: I hate you, too. You make me sick, you fat sack of crap.
Peter: But I'm the president.
Suck-up: The best there is.
Peter: But you just said you hated me.
Suck-up: But not you, the president, the you who said you hated you who... love, hate, Yankees, clouds...[head explodes]
Valet: I'll have that fixed for you tomorrow, sir.

Executive: Here's your new digs. Now, get to work, sport. We're counting on you.
Peter: Wow. My own office. Well, I guess I'd better get busy. [Pencil sharpening][sighs][sticks finger in pencil sharpener] Ah! [looks furtively around and unzips pants][prolonged screams]

Executive: Gentlemen, we have a problem. There's an anti smoking bill before Congress that could put us out of business.
Executive 2: Yes. Apparently causing cancer is this year's hot button.
Executive: I don't understand it. We've tried everything to get through to these politicians. Harvard lawyers, lobbyists, wisecracking leprechauns.
Leprechaun: Excuse me. Do you have a dollar? I'm a little short. [Laughs]
Executive 3: Maybe that's the problem. They're all idiots in Washington. Instead of a smart guy, we should send a moron they can relate to.
Executives: Yeah. Yeah. Good thought.
Executive: But where are we going to find someone within the company who's that stupid?
Executive 2: Yeah. And not just stupid. Fat, too.
Executives: Yeah, yeah. That's exactly what we need.
Executive 3: Hey, wait a second. Didn't we just make a fat, stupid guy president?
Executive: You bet we did. Gentlemen, our new tobacco lobbyist is That Guy!
 
Peter: So, uh, what's this big assignment you got for me, Chairman of the Broad?
Executive: [Laughs] Chairman of the Broad. When did you become such a stitch?
Peter: Don't you remember? You gave me writers. Sir, I don't want to say you're rich, but when you walk into a bank, all the tellers go, 'Whoopee!' That wasn't funny. I thought you guys said you were Jewish.
Writer: He's only half-Jewish.
Peter: You're fired.
Executive: Here's the thing, Griffin. Some troublemakers in Congress are trying to shut us down. We need someone important, like you, to go down to Washington and help those bastards see what kind of fun loving people the tobacco industry's really made of.
Peter: Washington? Ah, sweet. I'm your man. But I gotta warn you I made enemies on the Hill.

Peter: And that's when Clarence Thomas forced me into his chambers and showed me lewd pictures.
Senator: Mr. Griffin, we have indisputable evidence that not only have you never been in the same room as Clarence Thomas, you've never been in the same state. How do you respond to that?
Peter: Baba Booey! Baba Booey! Howard Stern's penis! Baba Booey! Baba Booey! Baba Booey!
 
Meg: How long will Dad be in Washington?
Lois: As long as it takes. He's a very important man now. You know, he's the spokesman for his entire industry. Thank you, Martha. Brian, could you pass me the TV Guide?
Brian: Piss off!
Lois: What?
Brian: I'm sorry. It just feels like forever since I've had a smoke. I'm just a bit testy. Stop staring at my tail!
 
Peter: Hello, Mr. Harrison? Yeah, I see those government guys you were telling me about. I'll show them a good time and bring them around to our side. Excuse me. Al Gore, George W. Bush?
Al Gore: Yes?
George W. Bush: Yes?
Peter: Ah, great. And what's your friend's name?
Al Gore: Dick Armey.
Peter: [Laughs] No, seriously. What's his name?
Al Gore: Dick Armey.
Peter: [Laughs]
Al Gore: [Laughs] Oh, I just got it.
Peter: Hey, Armey. What's your wife's name? Vagina Coast Guard? Nah, I'm kidding, you guys. Hey, get in the car. We're going to a skin bar.
All: Great. Yeah. Sounds good.

Senator: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I don't know what happened!
Peter: Whoa, it's okay, it's okay, Senator. This girl didn't have a family. It'll be like she never existed. Now grab a hold of yourself. All right. Now, listen. You may have killed her when you shoved those dollar bills down her throat. You may have killed her when you hit her with the stool. I don't know. I'm not a doctor. But I'll tell you what didn't kill her. Smoking!
Al Gore: You have our support, Griffin.

Lois: Look, kids. Here's your father in People magazine with Jim Carrey. And they're both Smokin'! I loved that in Mask. Smokin'! Smokin'! Smokin'!
Brian: Damn it! Do I have to listen to this drivel 24 hours a day? But I guess anything's better than looking at your smelly face!
Meg: Mom!
Lois: Honey, your face smells fine. You know he doesn't mean it. It's just the lack of nicotine.
Chris: Hey, Mom, the school janitor said that Dad's working for the bad guys. And he said it through a hole in his throat.
Lois: Well, That doesn't make him right.
Chris: If I had a hole in my throat, I'd put pennies in it!
Lois: Listen, your father's doing great work, and life's never been better.
Stewie: Yes, I, too, applaud the oaf for finally showing some initiative. God knows he was years overdue.
Lois: [Gasps]
Stewie: You know who I saw at the market today? Patty Croft. Oh, and she has gotten fat!
Lois: Oh, my God! Stewie, no! Oh, God. What have I done? I knew smoking was bad, but I still sold my soul. And for what? Martha Stewart? Come on, kids. We gotta put a stop to this. Now!
Martha Stewart: [Sighs] Finally. [Farting]

Lois: There you are! Peter, I caught Stewie smoking. That cigarette company is evil. We can't be a part of this anymore.
Peter: Lois, this is the best job I ever had! Hey, since I became president, profits have been higher than Alyssa Milano. [Laughs]
Aide: Mr. Griffin, time for your speech.
Lois: But, Peter, what about your son?
Peter: So Stewie had a puff. He's old enough to make his own decisions. For God's sakes, Lois, he's 1. Cut the umbilical cord!

Peter: Ladies and gentlemen of Congress, I am here today to talk about smoking.
Lois: Please, Peter, do the right thing.
Peter: I know a lot of you are already on my side. And for you naysayers, I have two strong words for you: come on! Come on!
Congressmen: Okay, sure. All right. Done.
Peter: Thank you, ladies and...
Stewie: [Stewie coughing] Baby needs to suck ash! Baby needs to suck ash! Not ass, you pervert. Save it for the interns.
Peter: Is that a baby? Oh, my God! That's Stewie! Lois was right! Children under 4 shouldn't smoke! Look, I don't care about this stupid job anymore. Cigarettes are bad!
Congressman: Mr. Griffin is right! Smoking is a horrible vice! It shortens life expectancy and pollutes our air. And according to recent polls, air is good.
Congressman 2: Cigarettes killed my father and raped my mother!
Congressman Frank: Gentlemen, I propose we send a message to tobacco companies everywhere by fining the El Dorado Cigarette Company infinity billion dollars!
Congressman 3: That's the spirit, Frank! But I think a real number might be more effective. All in favor of fining this evil tobacco giant $100 million, say "Aye"!
Congressmen: Aye! Aye!
Executive: But that'll bankrupt us!
Peter: Oh, you mean the way you've morally bankrupted America?
Congressmen: [Laughing]
Peter: Thanks for that zinger, boys. Now, give me a snappy line to go out on.
Writer: Actually, our lunch is here.
Peter: [Stuttering] Well, that's my mama! [Laughing nervously]

Diane Simmons: A tragic accident today in the north Providence area. A family of four lost their lives when their minivan swerved off the road and into a ravine, exploding on impact.
Tom Tucker: [Snickering]
Diane Simmons: Do you find this funny, Tom?
Tom Tucker: No, no, no. I was remembering, I accidentally put my shirt on inside out this morning. It's fine now, though. So, so, what were you saying? A fashion show?
 
Meg: Chris, turn the TV off. We gotta find an anniversary gift for Mom and Dad.
Chris: Don't look! We're shopping! We're shopping!
Lois: Oh, kids, you don't need to do anything special for our anniversary. Just your father.
Meg: I hope he doesn't wait and get your gift at the last minute again.
Lois: This year, instead of exchanging gifts, I told him it would be nice if we could just spend a romantic day together.
Stewie: Oh, dear! I think we all know what that means. [Imitating springs] Gross.

Cleveland: Hey, fellas! Guess what? I got us a tee time tomorrow at Barrington Country Club.
Quagmire: Barrington? Wow!
Peter: I'm in.
Brian: Uh, Peter, tomorrow's your anniversary.
Peter: Aw, crap! If Lois finds out I'm ditching her to play golf, she'll hit me with a frying pan... which is why I'm gonna drink this frying-pan antidote. All right, hit me with this. Didn't work.

Lois: What the hell? Lois, it's an anniversary scavenger hunt. Your first clue is at the Quahog Mini-Mart. Love, Peter. Oh, how fun!

Man: All right, gentlemen, before you tee off, here are your complimentary monogrammed bag towels, a sleeve of balls, and this mobile ball cleaner.
Caddie: Clean as a whistle, sir.
Peter: I'm not gonna get short by touching your spit, am I?
Caddie: You'd be the first, champ.

Peter: Well, it's about time.
Cleveland: Sorry, fellas. I'm not gonna be able to play. Loretta's mother is in town, and we have to go buy new sheets for the dog bed.
Loretta: Cleveland!
Cleveland: I mean, the pullout sofa bed.
Peter: Cleveland, this is Barrington. You could be the first black guy ever to play this course. People are gonna be impressed.
Golfer 1: Hey, a black guy!
Golfer 2: Fun!
Loretta: Come on, Cleveland.

Brian: Maybe we should play another time.
Peter: Screw that. I busted my ass keeping Lois busy so I could be here. Now, let's grip it and rip it.
 
Golfer: The Fed will be lowering rates, get your money out of T-bills and put it all into  waffles! Tasty waffles with lots of syrup!
Broker: Waffles! Buy waffles!
Brokers: Waffles! [All shouting]

Lois: Okay, kids. Keep your eyes peeled for a clue.
Stewie: Now what Jughead has done here, and it's really quite ingenious actually, is paint pupils on his eyelids, so he can sleep through class without Miss Grundy being any the wiser.
Chris: He's sleeping.
Meg: Mom, I found Dad's first clue.
Lois: I can't believe your father organized this. Usually he can't even handle simple tasks.

Lois: Peter, why is there a diaper in the lamp socket?
Stewie: Lois, he's done it again! Wait a minute. [Exclaims]

Brian: Let's pack it in. There's too much water out here.
Quagmire: Yeah. Let's hit the bar, huh?
Peter: Come on. There's worse things in life than rain. Like uh, like spiders.
 
Spider: He's behind the door!
Lois: [Coughing] Peter, he's bothering everyone. Say something.
Peter: Say something? I'll kick his ass. Someone ought to kick his ass.
Spider: Don't go in there!
Lois: Peter!
Peter: All right. Give me a Kleenex.
Spider: I knew he was bad. I knew... ah!

Caddie: Out of me way! They're after me Lucky Charms!
Quagmire: I paid him $10 to say it. Classic.
Brian: We'll be in the clubhouse.
Peter: Go on, run away! More golf course for me! That was close. That looks dangerous. Somebody's gonna get hurt. [straining] It'll be fine.

BOTH: You again?
Peter: Death, please, don't take me now.
Death: Relax. You're not dying. You're just having a near-death experience.
Peter: Thank God!
Death: Yeah, thank God. Thank God I get to hang out with a fascinating gent like yourself!
Peter: So, when am I gonna die?
Death: About two years after your wife divorces you.
Peter: What the hell are you talking about? Lois would never leave me. She's been crazy about me since the night we met.

Peter: My God, that's me! Look how thin I was!
Lois: My, this is certainly a beautiful night. I love looking at stars.
Peter: Say no more.
Lois: Peter, wait. I...
Peter: Very interesting. But stupid.
Lois: Oh, my God! I love Arte Johnson!
Peter: Why don't you give him a kiss?
Lois: Peter, get away from me.
Peter: Come on.
Lois: Stop it.
Peter: Give Arte Johnson a kiss.
 
Peter: Man! She was beautiful.
Death: Say, this looks awfully familiar. Wait a second! I remember this! That's me! Look at all that hair. I can't believe I thought that looked good. I must have been high.
Peter: I love you, Lois Pewterschmidt.
Lois: I love you, Peter Griffin.
Peter: Look at that. Huh, huh? There's no way she's gonna leave me. Now put me back in my freakin' body, all right?
Death: I can't put you back until you have a revelation. You know, one of those things that changes your life.
Peter: To hell with this. I'm going home.
Death: What are you doing? You can't get in that way.
Peter: I'm sure as hell not going in the back door.
Death: Crap! I don't have time for this. Listen, I'm late for an appointment. If you don't want to follow procedure, fine. Stay here in limbo.
Peter: No. Wait. I don't want to be in limbo!

Lois: Okay. It says the next note will be right under my nose.
Announcer: And they're off! And quick out in front, Silver Dasher, followed by My Nose!
Lois: Aha! Hold my purse!  [Dogs barking]
Chris: What's Mom doing?
Stewie: I'll tell you what she's doing, she's screwing up my six two. Damn it!
Announcer: My Nose in front, followed by Sea Biscuit, followed by Some Crazy Lady followed by Middle-Aged Housewife followed by Wait, Who's That? followed by Silver Dasher. And now it appears there's a woman chasing the dogs.
Lois: Let's go, kids!
Stewie: Blackie, tell the boys in Kansas City the bet's off.
Bettor: Too late, Stewie. The fix is in, and the noodles are boiling in the pot. Boiling, I tell you!
Stewie: Aaargh!

Peter: Wait a minute. I got it, I got it. I figured out my revelation: God loves a working man.
Death: No!
Peter: The Shadow is in reality Lamont Cranston, wealthy young man about town.
Death: No! Oh, crap! I'm late. I'm in big, big trouble!
Peter: Jeez, you're pretty shook up about that appointment of yours! You're Death. What are you afraid of?
Mrs. Death: Where the hell have you been? When I said lunch, I said noon, not noon-ish.
Death: Sorry, Ma.
Mrs. Death: Sorry? Is sorry gonna reheat the casserole? So, who's your friend?
Death: It's a work thing, Ma. Near-death experience.
Mrs. Death: Where are you going?
Death: I gotta take a leak.
Mrs. Death: Well, don't forget to zip up your fly. If you don't zip up your fly, a seagull will get you!
Death: God, she's a pain in the ass! I wish Dad was still dead.
Peter: I'll tell you, Lois' dad was a pain in the ass when I met him.

Peter: Hi. Can I take my tie off yet?
Lois: Peter, you look so wonderful. Are you nervous about meeting Daddy?
Peter: You'll know when I'm nervous.
Carter: Lois? [Farts]
Peter: Now. Lois, take the rap for this. I only get one chance to make a first impression.
Lois: Hi, Daddy. That was me. And this is Peter.
Peter: Hey, Mr. Pewterschmidt. What are you feeding this gal? Peter Griffin. Can I take this freakin' tie off?
Carter: It's a pleasure. My daughter is quite taken with you.
Peter: And I'm taken with her. I mean, look at this. Show us front and back there, Lois. Don't think I don't know where that comes from. That's some world-class juice you got brewing in the old flesh balloon down there, Carter. Oh, yeah.
Lois: I'm gonna go get my purse.
Peter: All right. Hey, based on what you've seen with your wife what can we expect in terms of droopage here? We talking a slight slope or the full fried-eggs-hanging-on-a-nail thing?
Carter: Peter, what do you think of this bronze statue?
Peter: It's nice.
Carter: It's early Etruscan.
Peter: Get out of here!
Carter: No, seriously.
Peter: That's great.

Captain: Hey, look. A manatee!
Chef: We can use it for soup.
Quagmire: Ensign Glen Quagmire. Welcome aboard. You picked a great day to get rescued. We were just about to sing a song about mopping.

Mrs. Death: Could you tell me when you're leaving to go back in time. I was talking to a robe on the coat rack for 20 minutes before I realized you weren't in it.
Death: Ma, for God's sake, leave me alone! I'm working!
Mrs. Death: Don't yell at your mother! If you yell at your mother, a hen will lay eggs in your tummy.
 
Peter: Wow, brilliantly choreographed.
Quagmire: Well, that's your tax dollars at work. Hey, why don't you join us and see the world?
Peter: Sorry, pal. I've seen the world, and its name is Lois.
Mrs. Death: How romantic! Why can't you find a nice girl?
Death: Ma, she's gonna dump him.
Mrs. Death: Well, at least he got that far. You know who he took to the prom? His cousin!
Peter: That's weak.
Mrs. Death: Yeah.
Death: All right, all right, that's it! I'm sick of both of you. Come on, Peter.
Mrs. Death: Death, put your jacket on, or you'll get frostbite!
Death: I don't have skin!
Mrs. Death: 'Cause you didn't eat your beans!
 
Death: Come on. Get back in your big, fat body. Why should I help a guy save his marriage when I can't even get a girl?
Peter: Whoa, wait! What are you saying?
Death: The revelation, jackass! It could have helped you save your marriage. But too late. And by the way, when the lightning hit you, you soiled yourself. Enjoy.
Peter: Wait. I can't lose Lois! Please, I'll do anything. What if I helped you get a girl?
Death: Really? You think you could do that?
Peter: Sure. All we gotta do is get you a little fixed up. Get you a haircut, give you a good clean... [Screams]... shave, maybe some cologne. The chicks'll be all over you.
Death: Gee! You really think so?
Peter: Absolutely. [Vomits]
Death: You got any SPF-50? I bleach like a gym sock.
Peter: Look, Death, will you relax? I told ya, the beach is a perfect place to pick up chicks. Now I want you to go over there, and ask those girls if you can play.
Death: Hey, can I join you?

Girl 1: I guess. What's your name?
Death: Josh.
Girl 1: Do you, like, live around here?
Death: No. I live with my mom.
Girl 1: Let's get out of here.
Girl 2: See ya, Josh. Tell your mom we said hi.
Man: Heads up!

Meg: How do we get up there? Dad put grease on the pole.
Chris: Don't worry, Meg. We've been studying fulcrums in school. You simply have to counter-balance the weight where the lever pivots. Like so.
Meg: Stewie, honey, want to play rocket ship?
Stewie: What the deuce?
Lois: Blast off! Go on, Stewie. Get the note for Mommy.
Stewie: How dare you use me for your own personal selfish... oh. Pull slower. I must remember to do this again when no one's around.

Death: What the hell was I thinking? You don't know anything about picking up chicks.
Peter: Are you kidding? I learned from the best.
Quagmire: Come on, buddy. We're dropping anchor in Jamaica!
Peter: Great! We're getting closer to Rhode Island.
Quagmire: Rhode Island? Forget that. I'm taking you out for some shore leave. Does this look like a penis to you?
Peter: No.
Quagmire: How about now?
Peter: Sorry, Quagmire. Your crotch just looks like Lois to me.
Quagmire: Well, let's ask her then. Hey, Lois, should Peter sit around and mope all night? Or should Peter go out with his buddy and have some fun? All right!

Quagmire: Okay, that one's a feminist type. She's into men. And that one's mad for jazz. Watch this. The plight of women in this hemisphere is deplorable! I can bench-press 800 pounds! You, me and Coltrane till dawn! There you go, Peter. One for you, two for me.
Peter: You guys go on without me. [Sighs]

Death: Why didn't you go with them?
Peter: You don't know what love's like.
Death: Oh, yeah? Her name's Amy. She works at a pet store. I met her when her dad hung himself. But I was too shy to ask her out.
Peter: What's with that moustache?
Death: Let me see that. Sorry. That's Edward James Olmos. Here. This is her.
Peter: Hey, nice ass.
Death: Sorry. No. That's Edward James Olmos' ass. I guess I don't have a photo. But trust me, she's cute.
Peter: Well, let's go get her.
Death: I need that picture of Olmos' ass back
Peter: Oh, yeah, right.

Meg: Mom, hurry! I can't stand the smell!
Lois: I found the note! Go back to the Mini-Mart? Well, this isn't very creative. Let's go, kids.
Chris: Mom, you remember that goldfish we flushed down the toilet? He wasn't dead.

Death: There she is. That's her.
Peter: All right, now go on, like we practiced.
Amy: Hey, you.
Death: Hi. I was just, in the neighborhood and so I thought that you.... This is a bad time. Maybe I'll just come back. Who'm I kidding? I'll never get her.
Peter: Not with that attitude. Come on! Robert Reed got Florence Henderson, and he was one of thema toe tapping Burgermeisters. You've gotta find a way to make it happen.
 
Quagmire: So long, Peter. I hope you find your girl.
Peter: Thanks, Quagmire. Hope you live next door to me someday.
Quagmire: Hey, does this look like a penis to you? [Girl screams]
Quagmire: How about now?

Cleveland: So, where is it you need to go, my new honky friend?
Peter: Rhode Island. That's not too far, is it?
Cleveland: Nothing's too far away from Maxine, the cheatin' queen. Women. That's not fair. I'm just speaking out of hurt. That truck's coming up on us awful fast.
Peter: Holy crap! Do you see what I see?
Cleveland: I'm afraid I do!
Peter: We're being chased by ghosts!

Death: So, you went through all this trouble to see your girl?
Peter: I sure did. And I'm just a fat idiot. What's your excuse, you big chicken?
Death: Chicken? You take that back!
Peter: Yeah? Make me!
Death: I don't make monkeys, I train 'em.
Peter: Holy crap! I'm sorry. Did that hurt?
Death: No. But this will!
Peter: You bastard!
Amy: What the hell is going on out here?
Death: Actually, I, uh...
Peter: He wanted to ask you something.
Death: Amy, you want to go somewhere and grab a coffee?
Amy: Sure. I get off at 2:00.
Death: Great! Great. I'll meet you here.
Peter: You did it! All right! Hey, who knows? You might even, you know...
Death: I'm not following you.
Peter: Intercourse.
Death: Ah.

Lois: What are you doing here?
Cleveland: Loretta's mom wanted a snack so we had to pick her up some Kibbles 'n' Bits.
Loretta: Cleveland!
Cleveland: I mean Cheezits.
Lois: Did Peter give you a clue for me?
Loretta: Peter? He's down at Barrington with Brian and Quagmire.
Lois: He's golfing on our anniversary?
Cleveland: Oh, boy! You just put Peter in the doghouse. Which is where your mother...
Loretta: Don't say it!
Cleveland: Your mother smells.

Death: See, this is why I hate clothes shopping. I have no ass. I'm minus an ass.
Peter: You're trying too hard, Death. She won't care what you're wearing. She's just gonna be glad to see you. That's how it was with Lois.

Peter: [Screams] Oh, God! Oh, God! [struggling] Hi, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
Carter: What the hell are you doing here?
Peter: It's a long story with some terrific performances and a wonderful scene at a carnival, but I'll cut to the ending. I want to marry Lois!
Carter: Out of the question! Now, listen, Griffin. I want you to take this, and stay away from my daughter forever!
Peter: $1 million?
Carter: $1 million.
Peter: No deal! Lois may be worth a million to you, but to me, she's worthless. I love her, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
Lois: Oh, Peter!

Peter: Holy crap! Back then, I gave up $1 million just to be with Lois. Now I won't even miss a lousy golf game to spend our anniversary together. No wonder she's gonna dump me.
Death: Or is she?
Peter: Wait a minute. That's my revelation. I gotta pay more attention to my wife!
Death: Eureka! Now, come on back to the golf course. I've got a date.
Peter: Death, wait. Before we go, I need you to do me one more favor.
Death: Peter! Peter Frampton!
Peter Frampton: Oh, no! God, please, no! I'm too young to die! Are you sure you're not supposed to be at Keith Richards' house?
Death: All right. If you want to live, come with me and bring your guitar, and bring that thing that makes it go... [Makes wah-wah sound]

Valet: Wait!
Lois: Damn! How could he lie to me on our anniversary?

Lois: Peter! Our song!
Peter: Happy anniversary, Lois.
Lois: This is the most romantic gift you've ever given me. How did you ever put all of this together?
Peter: Well, I had a little help from a very special friend.
 
Amy: I like animals.
Death: Uh-huh.
Amy: Because they're like people. Just little furry people.
Death: Yeah. Hey, you ever go on the Internet? They got some cool stuff there on that Internet.
Amy: Oh, yeah, I bought these shoes from a company on the Internet because they don't test on animals.
Death: [sighs]
Amy: You know, animals never have war. War is an invention of mankind.
Death: What the hell are you talking about? Animals fight all the time!
Amy: Not with nuclear arms. You can't hug your children with nuclear arms.
Death: Check, please.

Joe: Baby! Twelve in a row!
Peter: You must've had a great body before it went all funhouse mirror on you.
Lois: I can't believe how terrific you look.
Bonnie: Thanks. I've been taking tae-jitsu classes. You should come with me sometime.
Lois: I'd love to.
Bonnie: Oh, the baby's kicking. Want to feel?
Peter: Sure. Ow! Oh, You are freakin' dead, kid!
Lois: Peter!

Meg: I love this time of year.
Brian: Me, too. The summer tourists are gone, and we finally have the town to ourselves before those idiots from New York show up to watch the leaves change and take over the whole place.

Brian: Leafers!
Peter: Holy crap! We gotta get outta here!
Bonnie: What about the boat?
Joe: Leave it!
Lois: Hurry, Peter! They're almost here!
Chris: We're too late!
Man: Yo, Matty. Check out those colors. Yellow like a taxi, orange like the ball at the Knicks game and red like the sauce on my Mamma Mia's cu cazz.
Matty: Yeah, and brown like the guys I don't pick up in my cab.
Man: Beautiful!
ALL: Aaahhh!

Diane Simmons: Good evening. Tonight's top story: Quahog is infested with loud, hairy creatures, also known as New Yorkers.
Tom Tucker: They migrate north every autumn to see the foliage. I think I speak for all of us when I say New York and everyone from there can fornicate themselves with an iron stick.

Lois: We're gonna be late for church.
Peter: Move it! Damn leafers.
Meg: Chris, quit it! Mom, Chris put his foot on my side again!
Chris: I can't help it. I have these long dancer's legs.
Meg: Move it!
Stewie: Meg, stop whining! Chris, stay on your side! Lois, for God's sake, get off your ass and do some parenting!
Lois: If you kids don't knock it off, we're not going to McDonald's after church.
Both: Mom!
Peter: Don't worry, we're going. But you don't get the supersize.
Chris: Oh!
Peter: Okay, you can supersize, but no apple pie.
Meg: Come on!
Peter: Okay, you get an apple pie, but you can't blow on it.
Lois: Peter, don't contradict me in front of the kids!
Peter: Siblings fighting is as natural as a white man's dialogue in a Spike Lee movie.

Lois: Who are all these people?
Peter: Damn New Yorkers! They took all the good seats.
Elderly Woman: Aren't you precious? [Screams]
Stewie: Some of my novelty items were provided by Jack's Joke Shop of South Attleboro, Massachusetts. Remember, If it ain't funny, it ain't worth jack.
Priest: I'd like to welcome all our out of town parishioners. My cousin, Father Sapienza, is in from New York to see the leaves. And I'd like to invite him to do the opening prayer.
Father Sapienza: Yo! God is good, eh? And he expects us to be good. And if you're not, he's gonna come down and bust your freaking skull. Amen.
Man: Who do you think you're talking to? Your God ain't tougher than me!
Man 2: You can't talk to the Father like that, you stupid cafone! I oughta come overthere and break your freakin' arm!
Man: You wanna go, tough guy? I'll snap you in half like an almond biscotti from Valero's on 51st Street. Best in the city!
 
Peter: Fellas, this is God's house, and the Patriots kick off in about 45 minutes. Can we move this along?
Man: Patriots suck!
Peter: Blasphemy!
Man: It burns!
Scientist: Holy water? Where's that acid I ordered?
Stewie: Hey, Guido, watch this. I've got to lay off the coffee! That's Jack's, Exit 14 off 295.
 
Trainer: Tae-jitsu is about power for your body and your mind. Don't be afraid to free the beast inside you. Left kick, right kick, punch combo, stomp!
Trainer: Beautiful. Again. Left kick.
Trainer: You're doing great for your first lesson.
Lois: I'm really cutting loose. Just like Julie Andrews in that movie where she showed her breasts.
 
Man: Jets rule!
Peter: Hey, watch where you're going, will you? Hey, Horace, put the Pats game on the TV, and get me a few beers, huh?
Horace: Sorry, Peter. Someone stole the remotes... and the kegs. And I'm not sure, but I think I've been shot. Yep.
Man: Hey, pal, watch my seat. I gotta bleed the lizard.
Cleveland: Public urination is just wrong. Except during the Million Man March when protesters burned our Porta Potties. Then I used my stream of justice to put out the hate.
Quagmire: I don't know, fellas, I think there's potential in this crowd. Hey, honey, why don't you turn around and show me the Lower East Side?
 
Transvestite: Sure.
Quagmire: Whoa, transvestite! Back off! Wait a second. Pre-op or post-op?
Transvestite: Pre-op.
Quagmire: Whoa, transvestite! Back off! You're right. This place blows. We gotta send these strangers back where they came from.
Peter: Don't worry. I got an idea. An idea so smart my head would explode if I even began to know what I was talking about.

Peter: [Angry growl] I am a man-eating tree. Go back to New York, or I will eat you! Just like I ate insane New York anchorman Dan Rather. And look who I had for dessert. Asexual former mayor Ed Koch. Leave my land, or I will smite you with my powerful limb.
Man: What are you, nuts? Gimme that branch. Get off of me!
Peter: Why you...
Lois: Oh, my God! Stop fighting!
Peter: Holy crap!
Lois: Oh, my God!
Chris: Mom, you could be a world champion, and no one could hit you below the belt because girls don't have anything down there. Can you teach me to kick ass?
Lois: Oh, no. I do not condone violence. And I am not gonna be responsible for bringing fist fighting into our schools.
Brian: Gee, Lois. Can you hear me all the way back there in the '50s?
Stewie: Well, that was lame.
 
Lois: Poor Peter. I emasculated him in front of all those people. I think he's really upset.
Peter: Gather around, everybody. $10 is all it takes! Step right up and fight my wife! Come one, come all. She floats like a butterfly and stings like when I pee.
Lois: Peter, I am not a sideshow attraction, at least not anymore. I want you to get rid of all this right now because I am never fighting again. Ever!
Peter: Come on, Chris. We'll have to go to Plan B.
Chris: [growling] Oh, no! Ah! Oh, God! Oh, my God! Help me! Help me, for God's sake! He's gonna kill me! Help!
Peter: Don't worry. It's a trained bear. He's in no real danger.

Lois: He's teaching a class. I can't bother him now.
Peter: Sure you can. Hey! Hey, Ralph Macchio! My wife here needs to talk to you. There you go, honey.
Trainer: What is it, Lois?
Lois: I don't think I should do tae-jitsu anymore. I'm afraid I'm gonna hurt someone.
Trainer: But, Lois, you're my star pupil. I want you in my advanced class.
Lois: Advanced class? No, no, no, no. I'm trying to quit.
Trainer: Fine, quit. But get used to people walking all over you.
Peter: Wait, hold on there. Nobody walks all over my wife, because I won't let them.
Lois: Peter...
Peter: Quiet, Lois. Men are talking. She learns things eventually, it just takes her longer. Come on, honey, we're outta here. If you hurry, I'll let you try on hats. I won't let you buy, but you can try 'em on.
Lois: I'll do it.

Lois: Stewie, you want to swing?
Stewie: Yes. Why not? I'll have a go at it. Perhaps a quick stretch first. Damn! Must've pulled something playing hoops last week.
Lois: Excuse me. We were about to use that.
Woman: You snooze, you lose, lady.
Lois: You have two choices. Either my baby swings from this jungle gym, or you do.
Stewie: Whoo, Lois! Someone's wearing their ovaries on the outside!
Lois: She saw me walking to the swing!
Stewie: Yes, she saw you. Easy now.
Lois: Nobody walks all over me! Those days are over! Lois demands respect!
Stewie: [Screams] I smell a messy diaper. God! Why does that turn me on?
 
Chris: Hold it, Meg. Those two are mine.
Meg: What?
Chris: That's Randy and that's Fred. Randy is the messy one. Fred's very neat. When you get them together, hoo hoo, hold onto your sides.
Meg: Nice to meet you both.
Chris: Murderer!
Lois: Stop it, both of you! Starting now, you two are gonna love each other! Now stay that way.
Chris: It's gonna be weird to potty.

Peter: Sheesh, Lois, look at the garbage those damn leafers dumped on our lawn. New York Post, New York Magazine, the New York Mets.
Lois: Peter, I'm sick and tired of hearing you whine about the leafers! Take some action! Free the beast!
 
Quagmire: That was strangely arousing. [shouts] [Grunts] Hello, 911? It's Quagmire. Yeah. Yeah. It's in a window this time.
 
Brian: Wow, look at them run.
Peter: Wait a second, Brian. That gives me an idea.
Lois: The Drunken Clam? Why couldn't we go someplace fancy like The Olive Garden? Oh, the breadsticks. Me likey breadsticks! You're a big girl now. Stop it!
Peter: Hold on, Lois. Excuse me, New Yorker. I think you're in my seat, and I had sex with your mother last night.
Lois: Peter, are you crazy?
Man: What did you say?
Peter: About the seat, or about my plowing your father's wife?
Lois: What the hell are you doing?
Peter: Excuse me. Is your refrigerator running? Because if it is, it probably runs like you. Very homosexually.
Man: What?
Lois: You wanna dance?
Peter: Jets suck! Yankees suck! Knicks suck! Krypton sucks! That's right. Go back where you came from, you bastards.

Trainer: We'll conclude today's graduation ceremony with a demonstration by the black belts. Okay, people, let's show them what we've learned. Kathy, get in there with Lois.
Kathy: I can't. I have cramps.
Lois: Why are you putting me up against the scrubs, Jared? Why don't you be a man and fight me yourself?
Trainer: Lois, the sensei is a sacred position. I could never violate the spiritual bond of the student-master relationship.
Lois: Oh. Then allow me.
Trainer: The bond is broken!
Lois: Then spin the wheel, Raggedy Man!
Stewie: Go, Lois! Pummel him with your powerful fists of female fury! And then when he's weary, emasculate him with your incessant nagging! Women! Yakety, yak, yak, yak. You know. Enjoy the fight.
 
Lois: [Cry of victory]
Peter: Lois, that was amazing! Congratulations.
Lois: This is mine! This is where my babies come from!
 
Peter: Lois, I was watching that. What you looking at?
Lois: The underpants, lose 'em!
Peter: Actually, I sort of have a headache, kinda. See, maybe tomorrow, or...
Lois: Take 'em off!
Peter: Yeah. Okay, honey.

Stewie: Whoa! What the hell are you doing? Those are my graham crackers!
Peter: Run along, Stewie. Daddy had a rough night.
Stewie: Why you tottering, femme sucked dewberry. I'm going to go find something to strike you with. Excuse me.
Brian: Good morning. Peter, you look terrible. What happened?
Peter: Last night, Lois was the man!
Brian: Good Lord!
Peter: I just want you to know, Brian, I didn't cry.
Brian: It's okay.
Lois: Oh, no! Peter! Stewie, what did you do?
Brian: Looks like he freed the beast all over the back of Peter's head.
Lois: Oh, my God. This is my fault. This is my fault. I brought violence into this house! I am the worst mother in the world!
Stewie: Aha! I got it all on tape! 

Psychologist: Now, Stewart, I want you to take this Mommy doll and this Daddy doll and show me how they act together.
Stewie: Yes. Very well. All right. You see, Margaret, after 20-odd years of marriage, your curious indiscretions no longer phase me. Really? And I suppose you think I enjoy hanging onto those hammocky deposits of gin sugars you call buttocks? What was that? What did you just write there?
Psychologist: Give me that!
Stewie: Insecurity? Gender confusion? I'll give you something to write about! Ooh, look at me! I'm insane! I'm Martin Lawrence on a bender!
Psychologist: Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, does Stewart have a history of aggression?
Lois: No, no. Hitting Peter is the first violent thing he's ever done.
Stewie: Technically, the first act of violence was that time bomb I left ticking in your uterus before I came out. Happy 50th birthday, Lois.
Psychologist: It's obvious that your son is learning this behavior from someone.
Peter: I know who's responsible for Stewie's behavior. But if I told you who it was, Lois would beat the crap out of me.
Lois: Now, just a minute! The whole reason I started fighting is because of you! I felt weak! You never listen to me! You undermine me in front of the kids! And besides, you're not exactly Father Of The Year yourself.
Psychologist: Well, there seems to be a lot of anger in your household. You owe it to your son to learn how to manage these feelings.
Stewie: Manage what?

Lois: I know I went a little overboard with my tae-jitsu. But from now on, we're not gonna have any more anger in this house, okay?
Meg: Well, then tell Chris to quit drawing pictures of me with a pig's body.
Chris: Don't censor me!
Lois: No more anger! Okay. The psychologist wants us to try an exercise called role reversal, where we pretend to be the person who makes us angry. I'll go first. Don't listen to your mother, kids. She's worthless and dumb, and ignore her, and only listen to me-Peter.
Peter: I'm Lois. I brake for yard sales. But I don't let Peter buy anything he likes. Like that Narragansett beer stein where the hot chick has two mugs for jugs. It was eight freakin' dollars, and we have a dozen places to put it!
Stewie: Oh, oh, me next, me next! I'm the dog. I'm well-read and have a diverse stock portfolio. But I'm not above eating grass clippings and regurgitating them on the small braided rug near the door.
Brian: I'm a pompous little anti-Christ who will probably abandon my plans for world domination when I grow up and fall in love with a rough trick named Jim.
 
Brian: Whoa, whoa, Peter, calm down.
Peter: I'm sick of Lois' anger-management techniques, Brian. They're not working.
Brian: What about the writing angry letters and not sending them exercise?
Peter: Aw, jeez, I wasn't supposed to send those?
Meg: Look. I got a letter from Dad. Dear Meg, for the first four years of your life, I thought you were a housecat. Dad!
Stewie: Dear Stewie, get out. Oh, that's nice.
Lois: Mine just says, Dear Lois. And after that, it looks like someone just spit on the paper! You got something to say to me?
Peter: Yeah. PS... [Deep snort] Hold on a second.

Brian: Hold on, hold on. Relax. Everybody, relax. All right, look, I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but we need to get our anger under control before we kill each other. No, my psychiatrist gave me these pills. They're mood elevators. I think they could help... even us out.
Lois: We're not taking pills. It's not natural.
Peter: Neither is bleaching the hair on your upper lip, Martin Mull!
Lois: Give us the pills!

ALL: Oom, bop bop.
Lois: That was fun. What country should we do next?
Chris: Monaco! Oh, wait. That's a principality.
Brian: You guys want to hear something really funny? Those pills I gave you were placebos. Sugar pills!
Peter: Wait a minute. Are you telling me I sang Ladysmith Black Mambazo for nothing?
Lois: Did it kill you to be multi-cultural for a minute?
Peter: I died a little inside, yes. You happy now?
Lois: Don't you use that tone of voice, you...
Peter: What were you going to say? Fat ass?
Chris: Wide load?
Meg: Dough boy?
Stewie: Country virtuoso Roy Clark?
Lois: How about all of the above?
Peter: How is this for a name? Miss, Pony Express is in. What do you got for me, Joe? Let me see here. It's here somewhere. Here we are. A big bag of liver spots for Lois!
 
Peter: You just hit me.
Lois: That's right! You can't hit me! I'm a girl!
Peter: Sometimes I wonder. Kicking, Lois?
Lois: Hurts, doesn't it?
Peter: You tell me.
Chris: Go, Dad! Kick her ass!
Meg: Shut up! This is all Dad's fault!
Chris: I don't like to be touched!

Brian: [Laughing] Man, I'm glad we got that out of our systems.
Meg: I wonder what came over us?
Chris: Maybe people are naturally violent.
Lois: I don't believe that. I think it's all the TV we watch. There's so much violence.
Peter: Yeah. TV is dangerous. Why doesn't the hell doesn't the government step in and tell us what we can and can't watch? And shame on the network that puts this junk on the air!
Lois: Peter? Peter, maybe you shouldn't say anything bad about the network.
Peter: Why? What are they gonna do? Cut our budget? I'm gonna go get a beer.
